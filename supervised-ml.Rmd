# Intro {-}

Machine learning (ML) develops algorithms to identify patterns in data (unsupervised ML) or make predictions and inferences (supervised ML). 

Supervised ML trains the machine to learn from prior examples to *predict* either a categorical outcome (classification) or a numeric outcome (regression), or to *infer* the relationships between the outcome and its explanatory variables.  

Two early forms of supervised ML are *[linear regression (OLS)](http://rpubs.com/mpfoley73/527767)* and *[generalized linear models (GLM)](http://rpubs.com/mpfoley73/527573)* (Poisson and logistic regression).  These methods have been improved with advanced linear methods, including *stepwise selection*, [*regularization*](http://rpubs.com/mpfoley73/521922) (ridge, lasso, elastic net), *principal components regression*, and *partial least squares*.  With greater computing capacity, non-linear models are now in use, including *polynomial regression*, *step functions*, *splines*, and generalized additive models (*GAM*).  [Decision trees](http://rpubs.com/mpfoley73/529130) (*bagging*, *random forests*, and, *boosting*) are additional options for regression and classification, and *support vector machines* is an additional option for classification.

These notes rely on PSU^[Penn State University, STAT 501, Lesson 12: Multicollinearity & Other Regression Pitfalls. [https://newonlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/12](https://newonlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/12).], STHDA^[STHDA.  Bootstrap Resampling Essentials in R.  [http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/38-regression-model-validation/156-bootstrap-resampling-essentials-in-r/](http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/38-regression-model-validation/156-bootstrap-resampling-essentials-in-r/)], and [@Molner2020],

The population regression model $E(Y) = X \beta$ summarizes the trend between the predictors and the mean responses.  The individual responses are assumed to be normally distributed about the population regression, $y_i = X_i \beta + \epsilon_i$ with varying mean, but constant variance, $y_i \sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2).$  Equivalently, the model presumes a linear relationship between $y$ and $X$ with residuals $\epsilon$ that are independent normal random variables with mean zero and constant variance $\sigma^2$.  Estimate the population regression model coefficients as $\hat{y} = X \hat{\beta}$, and the population variance as $\hat{\sigma}^2$.  The most common method of estimating the $\beta$ coefficients and $\sigma$ is ordinary least squares (OLS).  OLS minimizes the sum of squared residuals from a random sample.  The predicted values vary about the actual value, $e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$, where $\hat{y}_i = X_i \hat{\beta}$.

The OLS model is the best linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) if the residuals are independent random variables normally distributed with mean zero and constant variance. Recall these conditions with the LINE pneumonic: **L**inear, **I**ndependent, **N**ormal, and **E**qual.

**Linearity**. The explanatory variables are each linearly related to the response variable: $E(\epsilon | X_j) = 0$.  

**Independence**. The residuals are unrelated to each other. Independence is violated by repeated measurements and temporal regressors. 

**Normality**. The residuals are normally distributed: $\epsilon|X \sim N(0, \sigma^2I)$.  

**Equal Variances**. The variance of the residuals is constant (homoscedasticity): $E(\epsilon \epsilon' | X) = \sigma^2I$

Additionally, there should be little **multicollinearity** among the explanatory variables.

If the modeling objective is inference, fit the model with the full data set, evaluate the model fit, and interpret the parameter estimates. If the objective is prediction, fit the model with a partitioned train/test data set, cross-validate the fit with the test set, then deploy the model. Both are covered below.

## Parameter Estimation

There are two model parameters to estimate: $\hat{\beta}$ estimates the coefficient vector $\beta$, and $\hat{\sigma}$ estimates the variance of the residuals along the regression line. Derive $\hat{\beta}$ by minimizing the sum of squared residuals $SSE = (y - X \hat{\beta})' (y - X \hat{\beta})$.  The result is

$$\hat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1}X'y.$$

The residual standard error (RSE) estimates the sample deviation around the population regression line. *(Think of each value of $X$ along the regression line as a subpopulation with mean $y_i$ and variance $\sigma^2$.  This variance is assumed to be the same for all $X$.)* 

$$\hat{\sigma} = \sqrt{(n-k-1)^{-1} e'e}.$$

The standard error for the coefficient estimators is the square root of the error variance divided by $(X'X)$.

$$SE(\hat{\beta}) = \sqrt{\hat{\sigma}^2 (X'X)^{-1}}.$$

### Example {-}

Dataset `mtcars` contains response variable fuel consumption `mpg` and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles.  What is the relationship between the response and its predictors?

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data("mtcars")
mt_cars <- mtcars %>%
  mutate(
    vs = factor(vs, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("V", "S")),
    am = factor(am, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("automatic", "manual"))
  )
glimpse(mt_cars)
```

The correlation matrix of the numeric variables shows `wt` has the strongest association with `mpg` (*r* = -0.87) followed by `disp` (*r* = -0.85) and `hp` (*r* = -0.78). `drat` is moderately correlated (*r* = 0.68), and `qsec` is weakly correlated (*r* = 0.42). Many predictors are strongly correlated with each other.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
mt_cars %>%
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>%
  cor() %>%
  corrplot::corrplot(type = "upper", method = "number")
```

Boxplots of the categorical variables reveal differences in levels.

```{r}
mt_cars %>%
  select(mpg, where(is.factor)) %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.factor), as.character)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -mpg) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = mpg)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(name), scales = "free_x")
```

Fit a population model to the predictors.

```{r}
fit <- lm(mpg ~ ., data = mt_cars)
summary(fit)
```

`summary()` shows $\hat{\beta}$ as `Estimate`, $SE({\hat{\beta}})$ as `Std. Error`, and $\hat{\sigma}$ as `Residual standard error`.  You can manually perform these calculations using matrix algebra^[Help with matrix algebra in r notes at [R for Dummies](https://www.dummies.com/programming/r/how-to-do-matrix-arithmetic-in-r/)].  Recall, $\hat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1}X'y$.

```{r}
X <- model.matrix(fit)
y <- mt_cars$mpg

(beta_hat <- solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X) %*% y)
```

The residual standard error is $\hat{\sigma} = \sqrt{(n-k-1)^{-1} \hat{e}'\hat{e}}$.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
n <- nrow(X)
k <- ncol(X) - 1  # exclude the intercept term
y_hat <- X %*% beta_hat
sse <- sum((y - y_hat)^2)
(dof <- n - k - 1)
(rse <- sqrt(sse / dof))
```

The standard errors of the coefficients are $SE(\hat{\beta}) = \sqrt{\hat{\sigma}^2 (X'X)^{-1}}$.

```{r}
(se_beta_hat <- sqrt(diag(rse^2 * solve(t(X) %*% X))))
```

## Model Assumptions

The linear regression model assumes the relationship between the predictors and the response is linear and the residuals are independent random variables normally distributed with mean zero and constant variance. Additionally, you will want to check for multicollinearity in the predictors because it can produce unreliable coefficient estimates and predicted values. The `plot()` function produces a set of diagnostic plots to test the assumptions.

Use the **Residuals vs Fitted** plot, $e \sim \hat{Y}$, to test the linearity and equal error variances assumptions. The plot also identifies outliers. The polynomial trend line should show that the residuals vary around $e = 0$ in a straight horizontal line (linearity). The residuals should have random scatter in a band of constant width around 0, and no fan shape at the low and high ends (equal variances). All tests and intervals are sensitive to the equal variances condition. The plot also reveals multicollinearity. If the residuals and fitted values are correlated, multicollinearity may be a problem.

Use the **Q-Q Residuals** plot (aka, residuals normal probability plot) to test the normality assumption. It plots the theoretical percentiles of the normal distribution versus the observed sample percentiles. It should be approximately linear with no bow-shaped deviations. Sometimes this normality check fails when the linearity check fails, so check for linearity first. Parameter estimation is not sensitive to the normality assumption, but prediction intervals are.

Use the **Scale-Location** plot, $\sqrt{e / sd(e)} \sim \hat{y}$, to test for equal variance (aka, homoscedasticity). The square root of the absolute value of the residuals should be spread equally along a horizontal line.

The **Residuals vs Leverage** plot identifies influential observations. The standardized residuals should fall within the 95% probability band.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(fit, labels.id = NULL)
```

These diagnostics are usually sufficient. If any of the diagnostics fail, you can re-specify the model or transform the data.

Consider the linearity assumption. The explanatory variables should _each_ be linearly related to the response variable: $E(\epsilon | X_j) = 0$. The **Residuals vs Fitted** plot tested this overall. A curved pattern in the residuals indicates a curvature in the relationship between the response and the predictor that is not explained by the model. There are other tests of linearity. The full list:

* Residuals vs fits plot $(e \sim \hat{Y})$ should randomly vary around 0. 
* Observed vs fits plot $(Y \sim \hat{Y})$ should be symmetric along the 45-degree line.  
* Each $(Y \sim X_j )$ plot should have correlation $\rho \sim 1$.  
* Each $(e \sim X_j)$ plot should exhibit no pattern.

The diagnostic plots above look pretty good except for some evidence of heteroskedasticity at the upper end of predicted values. You might drill into the linearity condition to start. Start with plots of $(Y \sim X_j )$ - are the correlation coefficients ~1? Yes, all but `qsec` have correlations over .6.

```{r}
x <- mt_cars %>%
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>%
  pivot_longer(-mpg)

x_cor <- x %>% 
  nest(.by = name) %>%
  mutate(val_corr = map_dbl(data, ~cor(.$mpg, .$value)))

x %>%
  inner_join(x_cor, by = join_by(name)) %>%
  mutate(name = glue::glue("{name}, r = {comma(val_corr, .01)}")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y ~ x", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(name), scales = "free_x") +
  labs(title = "Response vs Predictor")
```

How about $(e \sim X_j)$? `disp` has a wave pattern; `hp` is u-shaped; `qsec` has increase variance in the middle.

```{r}
mt_cars %>%
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>%
  pivot_longer(-mpg) %>% 
  nest(.by = name) %>%
  mutate(
    fit = map(data, ~lm(mpg ~ value, data = .)),
    aug = map(fit, broom::augment)
  ) %>%
  unnest(aug) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y ~ x", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(name), scales = "free_x") +
  labs(title = "Residuals vs Predictor")
```

If the linearity condition fails, change the functional form of the model with non-linear transformations of the explanatory variables. A common way to do this is with Box-Cox transformations. 

$$w_t = \begin{cases} \begin{array}{l} log(y_t) \quad \quad \lambda = 0 \\
(y_t^\lambda - 1) / \lambda \quad \text{otherwise} \end{array} \end{cases}$$

$\lambda$ can take any value, but values near the following yield familiar transformations.

* $\lambda = 1$ yields no substantive transformation.  
* $\lambda = 0.5$ is a square root plus linear transformation.
* $\lambda = 0.333$ is a cube root plus linear transformation.
* $\lambda = 0$ is a natural log transformation.
* $\lambda = -1$ is an inverse transformation.

A common source of non-linearity is skewed response or predictor variables (see discussion [here](https://blog.minitab.com/blog/applying-statistics-in-quality-projects/how-could-you-benefit-from-a-box-cox-transformation)). `mt_cars` has some skewed variables.

```{r message=FALSE}
mt_cars %>%
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(name), scales = "free_x") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of numeric vars")
```

`hp` has the most skew, `cyl` the least.

```{r}
mt_cars %>% select(where(is.numeric)) %>% moments::skewness()
```

Compare the residuals vs fitted plots for each variable. Here is `hp`.

```{r}
lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mt_cars) %>% plot(which = 1, main = "hp")
```

and here is `cyl`

```{r}
lm(mpg ~ cyl, data = mt_cars) %>% plot(which = 1, main = "drat")
```

Box-Cox transform the numeric variables. The skew is reduced.

```{r}
rec <- recipe(~., data = mt_cars)

mt_cars_boxcox <- rec %>% 
  step_BoxCox(all_numeric()) %>%
  prep(training = mt_cars) %>%
  bake(new_data = NULL)

mt_cars_boxcox %>% select(where(is.numeric)) %>% moments::skewness()
```

The diagnostic plot for `hp` looks much better (notice the much smaller y-axis).

```{r}
lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mt_cars_boxcox) %>% plot(which = 1, main = "hp - after Box-Cox")
```

Did this create a better fitting model? A little: R^2 increased from .87 to .89.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
# Before
fit %>% glance()

# After
fit_boxcox <- lm(mpg ~ ., data = mt_cars_boxcox %>% select(-c(gear, carb)))
fit_boxcox %>% glance()
```

Here's a look at the diagnostic plots for the new model.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(fit_boxcox, labels.id = NULL)
```

How about those linearity tests? Most look a little better.

```{r}
x <- mt_cars_boxcox %>%
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>%
  pivot_longer(-mpg)

x_cor <- x %>% 
  nest(.by = name) %>%
  mutate(val_corr = map_dbl(data, ~cor(.$mpg, .$value)))

x %>%
  inner_join(x_cor, by = join_by(name)) %>%
  mutate(name = glue::glue("{name}, r = {comma(val_corr, .01)}")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y ~ x", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(name), scales = "free_x") +
  labs(title = "Response vs Predictor - Box-Cox Transformed")
```

How about $(e \sim X_j)$? Much better

```{r}
mt_cars_boxcox %>%
  select(where(is.numeric)) %>%
  pivot_longer(-mpg) %>% 
  nest(.by = name) %>%
  mutate(
    fit = map(data, ~lm(mpg ~ value, data = .)),
    aug = map(fit, broom::augment)
  ) %>%
  unnest(aug) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = .resid)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y ~ x", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(name), scales = "free_x") +
  labs(title = "Residuals vs Predictor - Box-Cox Transformed")
```

### Multicollinearity

The multicollinearity condition is violated when two or more of the predictors in a regression model are correlated.  Muticollinearity can occur for *structural* reasons, as when one variable is a transformation of another variable, or for *data* reasons, as occurs in observational studies.  Multicollinearity is a problem because it inflates the variances of the estimated coefficients, resulting in larger confidence intervals.

When predictor variables are correlated, the precision of their estimated regression coefficients decreases.  The usual interpretation of a slope coefficient as the change in the mean response for each additional unit increase in the predictor when all the other predictors are held constant breaks down because changing one predictor necessarily changes the others.

The residuals vs fits plot $(\epsilon \sim \hat{Y})$ should have correlation $\rho \sim 0$. A correlation matrix is helpful for picking out the correlation strengths. A good rule of thumb is correlation coefficients should be less than 0.80. However, this test may not work when a variable is correlated with a function of other variables. A model with multicollinearity may have a significant *F*-test with insignificant individual slope estimator t-tests. Another way to detect multicollinearity is by calculating variance inflation factors (VIF).  The predictor variance $Var(\hat{\beta_k})$ increases by a factor 

$$\mathrm{VIF}_k = \frac{1}{1 - R_k^2}$$

where $R_k^2$ is the $R^2$ of a regression of the $k^{th}$ predictor on the remaining predictors.  A $VIF_k$ of $1$ indicates no inflation (no correlation).  A $VIF_k >= 4$ warrants investigation.  A $VIF_k >= 10$ requires correction.

Does the model `mpg ~ .` exhibit multicollinearity? Recall that the correlation matrix had several correlated predictors. E.g., `disp` is strongly correlated with `wt` (r = 0.89) and `hp` (r = 0.79). How about the VIFs?

```{r}
car::vif(fit_boxcox)
```

Three predictors have VIFs greater than 10 (`cyl`, `disp`, and `wt`). One way to address multicollinearity is removing one or more of the violating predictors from the regression model. Try removing `disp`.

```{r}
lm(mpg ~ . - disp, data = mt_cars_boxcox) %>% car::vif()
```

Removing `disp` reduced the VIFs of the other variables, but `cyl` is still above 10. It may be worth dropping it from the model too. The model summary shows that `wt` is the only significant predictor.

```{r}
lm(mpg ~ . - disp, data = mt_cars_boxcox) %>% summary()
```

## Prediction

The standard error in the **expected value** of $\hat{y}$ at some new set of predictors $X_n$ is 

$$SE(\mu_\hat{y}) = \sqrt{\hat{\sigma}^2 (X_n (X'X)^{-1} X_n')}.$$  

The standard error increases the further $X_n$ is from $\bar{X}$.  If $X_n = \bar{X}$, the equation reduces to $SE(\mu_\hat{y}) = \sigma / \sqrt{n}$.  If $n$ is large, or the predictor values are spread out, $SE(\mu_\hat{y})$ will be relatively small.  The $(1 - \alpha)\%$ **confidence interval** is $\hat{y} \pm t_{\alpha / 2} SE(\mu_\hat{y})$.

The standard error in the **predicted value** of $\hat{y}$ at some $X_{new}$ is 

$$SE(\hat{y}) = SE(\mu_\hat{y})^2 + \sqrt{\hat{\sigma}^2}.$$

Notice the standard error for a predicted value is always greater than the standard error of the expected value.  The $(1 - \alpha)\%$ **prediction interval** is $\hat{y} \pm t_{\alpha / 2} SE(\hat{y})$.

Calculate confidence interval and prediction interval for `mpg` for predictor values at their mean.

```{r message=FALSE}
new_data <- mt_cars %>% 
  summarize(across(where(is.numeric), mean)) %>%
  mutate(vs = "S", am = "manual")

list(
  Confidence = predict.lm(fit, newdata = new_data, interval = "confidence"),
  Prediction = predict.lm(fit, newdata = new_data, interval = "prediction")
)
```

Verify this by calculating $SE(\mu_\hat{y}) = \sqrt{\hat{\sigma}^2 (X_{new} (X'X)^{-1} X_{new}')}$ and $SE(\hat{y}) = SE(\mu_\hat{y})^2 + \sqrt{\hat{\sigma}^2}$ with matrix algebra.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
X2 <- lapply(data.frame(model.matrix(fit)), mean) %>% unlist() %>% t()
X2[8] <- 1
X2[9] <- 1

y_exp <- sum(fit$coefficients * as.numeric(X2))

# Standard error of expected and predicted values
se_y_exp <- as.numeric(sqrt(rse^2 * X2 %*% solve(t(X) %*% X) %*% t(X2)))
se_y_hat <- sqrt(rse^2 + se_y_exp^2)

# Margins of error
t_crit <- qt(p = .05 / 2, df = n - k - 1, lower.tail = FALSE)
me_exp <- t_crit * se_y_exp
me_hat <- t_crit * se_y_hat

list(
  Confidence = c(fit = y_exp, lwr = y_exp - me_exp, upr = y_exp + me_exp),
  Prediction = c(fit = y_exp, lwr = y_exp - me_hat, upr = y_exp + me_hat)
)
```

## Inference

Draw conclusions about the significance of the coefficient estimates with the *t*-test and/or *F*-test.

### *t*-Test

By assumption, the residuals are normally distributed, so the *Z*-test statistic could evaluate the parameter estimators, 

$$Z = \frac{\hat{\beta} - \beta_0}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 (X'X)^{-1}}}$$ 

where $\beta_0$ is the null-hypothesized value, usually 0.  $\sigma$ is unknown, but $\frac{\hat{\sigma}^2 (n - k)}{\sigma^2} \sim \chi^2$.  The ratio of the normal distribution divided by the adjusted chi-square $\sqrt{\chi^2 / (n - k)}$ is t-distributed, 

$$t = \frac{\hat{\beta} - \beta_0}{\sqrt{\hat{\sigma}^2 (X'X)^{-1}}} = \frac{\hat{\beta} - \beta_0}{SE(\hat{\beta})}$$

The $(1 - \alpha)$ confidence intervals are $CI = \hat{\beta} \pm t_{\alpha / 2, df} SE(\hat{\beta})$ with *p*-value equaling the probability of measuring a $t$ of that extreme, $p = P(t > |t|)$.  For a one-tail test, divide the reported p-value by two.  The $SE(\hat{\beta})$ decreases with i) a better fitting regression line (smaller $\hat{\sigma}^2$), ii) greater variation in the predictor (larger $X'X$), and iii) larger sample size (larger n).

The `summary()` output shows the t values and probabilities in the `t value` and `Pr(>|t|)` columns. Verify this using matrix algebra to solve $t = \frac{(\hat{\beta} - \beta_1)}{SE(\hat{\beta})}$ with $\beta_1 = 0$. The $(1 - \alpha)$ confidence interval is $CI = \hat{\beta} \pm t_{\alpha / 2, df} SE(\hat{\beta})$.

```{r}
t <- beta_hat / se_beta_hat
p_value <- pt(q = abs(t), df = n - k - 1, lower.tail = FALSE) * 2
t_crit <- qt(p = .05 / 2, df = n - k - 1, lower.tail = FALSE)
lcl = beta_hat - t_crit * se_beta_hat
ucl = beta_hat + t_crit * se_beta_hat
data.frame(beta = round(beta_hat, 4), 
           se = round(se_beta_hat, 4), 
           t = round(t, 4), 
           p = round(p_value, 4),
           lcl = round(lcl,4), 
           ucl = round(ucl, 4)) %>% knitr::kable()
```

### *F*-Test

The *F*-test for the model is a test of the null hypothesis that none of the independent variables linearly predict the dependent variable, that is, the model parameters are jointly zero: $H_0 : \beta_1 = \ldots = \beta_k = 0$.  The regression mean sum of squares $MSR = \frac{(\hat{y} - \bar{y})'(\hat{y} - \bar{y})}{k-1}$ and the error mean sum of squares $MSE = \frac{\hat{\epsilon}'\hat{\epsilon}}{n-k}$ are each chi-square variables.  Their ratio has an *F* distribution with $k - 1$ numerator degrees of freedom and $n - k$ denominator degrees of freedom.  The F statistic can also be expressed in terms of the coefficient of correlation $R^2 = \frac{MSR}{MST}$.  

$$F(k - 1, n - k) = \frac{MSR}{MSE} = \frac{R^2}{1 - R^2} \frac{n-k}{k-1}$$

*MSE* is $\sigma^2$.  If $H_0$ is true, that is, there is no relationship between the predictors and the response, then $MSR$ is also equal to $\sigma^2$, so $F = 1$.  As $R^2 \rightarrow 1$, $F \rightarrow \infty$, and as $R^2 \rightarrow 0$, $F \rightarrow 0$.  *F* increases with $n$ and decreases with $k$.

What is the probability that all parameters are jointly equal to zero? The *F*-statistic is presented at the bottom of the `summary()` function. Verify this manually.

```{r}
ssr <- sum((fit$fitted.values - mean(mt_cars$mpg))^2)
sse <- sum(fit$residuals^2)
sst <- sum((fit$mpg - mean(mt_cars$mpg))^2)
msr <- ssr / k
mse <- sse / (n - k - 1)
f = msr / mse
p_value <- pf(q = f, df1 = k, df2 = n - k - 1, lower.tail = FALSE)
cat("F-statistic: ", round(f, 4), " on 3 and 65 DF,  p-value: ", p_value)
```

There is sufficient evidence (*F* = 17.35, *p* < .0001) to reject $H_0$ that the parameter estimators are jointly equal to zero.

`aov()` calculates the sequential sum of squares. The regression sum of squares SSR for `mpg ~ cyl` is 817.7.  Adding `disp` to the model increases SSR by 37.6. Adding `hp` to the model increases SSR by 9.4. It would seem that `hp` does not improve the model.

```{r}
summary(aov(fit))
```

Order matters. Had we started with `disp`, then added `hp` we would find both estimators were significant.

```{r}
summary(aov(lm(mpg ~ disp + hp + ., data = mt_cars)))
```

## Interpretation

A plot of the standardized coefficients shows the relative importance of each predictor. The distance the coefficients are from zero shows how much a change in a standard deviation of the predictor changes the mean of the predicted value. The CI shows the precision. The plot shows not only which variables are significant, but also which are important.

```{r warning=FALSE}
mt_cars_scaled <- mt_cars %>% mutate(across(where(is.numeric), scale))
fit_scaled <- lm(mpg ~ ., mt_cars_scaled)

fit_scaled %>%
  tidy() %>%
  mutate(
    lwr = estimate - qt(.05/2, fit_scaled$df.residual) * std.error,
    upr = estimate + qt(.05/2, fit_scaled$df.residual) * std.error,
  ) %>%
  filter(term != "(Intercept)") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(y = term, x = estimate)) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(y = term, xmin = lwr, xmax = upr), width = .2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = 4) +
  labs(title = "Model Feature Importance", x = "Standardized Weight", y = NULL)  
```

The added variable plot shows the bivariate relationship between $Y$ and $X_i$ after accounting for the other variables.  For example, the partial regression plots of `y ~ x1 + x2 + x3` would plot the residuals of `y ~ x2 + x3` vs `x1`, and so on.

```{r fig.height=9}
car::avPlots(fit, layout = c(4, 3))
```

## Model Validation

Evaluate predictive accuracy by training the model on a training data set and testing on a test data set.

### Accuracy Metrics

The most common measures of model fit are R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, RMSE, RSE, MAE, AIC, AICc, BIC, and Mallow's Cp.

### R-Squared

The coefficient of determination (**R-squared**) is the percent of total variation in the response variable that is explained by the regression line.  

$$R^2 = \frac{RSS}{SST} = 1 - \frac{SSE}{SST}$$

where $SSE = \sum_{i=1}^n{(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}$ is the sum squared differences between the predicted and observed value, $SST = \sum_{i = 1}^n{(y_i - \bar{y})^2}$ is the sum of squared differences between the observed and overall mean value, and $RSS = \sum_{i=1}^n{(\hat{y}_i - \bar{y})^2}$ is the sum of squared differences between the predicted and overall mean "no-relationship line" value.  At the extremes, $R^2 = 1$ means all data points fall perfectly on the regression line - the predictors account for *all* variation in the response; $R^2 = 0$ means the regression line is horizontal at $\bar{y}$ - the predictors account for *none* of the variation in the response.  In the simple case of a single predictor variable, $R^2$ equals the squared correlation between $x$ and $y$, $Cor(x,y)$. 

```{r collapse=TRUE}
ssr <- sum((fit$fitted.values - mean(mt_cars$mpg))^2)
sse <- sum(fit$residuals^2)
sst <- sum((mt_cars$mpg - mean(mt_cars$mpg))^2)
(r2 <- ssr / sst)
(r2 <- 1 - sse / sst)
(r2 <- summary(fit)$r.squared)
```

The sums of squares are the same thing as the variances multiplied by the degrees of freedom.

```{r}
ssr2 <- var(fitted(fit)) * (n - 1)
sse2 <- var(residuals(fit)) * (n - 1)
sst2 <- var(mt_cars$mpg) * (n - 1)
ssr2 / sst2
```

$R^2$ is also equal to the correlation between the fitted value and observed values, $R^2 = Cor(Y, \hat{Y})^2$.

```{r}
cor(fit$fitted.values, mt_cars$mpg)^2
```

R-squared is proportional to the the variance in the response, *SST*.  Given a constant percentage error in predictions, a test set with relatively low variation in the reponse will have a lower R-squared.  Conversely, test sets with large variation, e.g., housing data with home sale ranging from $60K to $2M may have a large R-squared despite average prediction errors of >$10K.

A close variant of R-squared is the non-parametric Spearman's rank correlation.  This statistic is the correlation of the *ranks* of the response and the predicted values.  It is used when the model goal is ranking.  

The **adjusted R-squared** ($\bar{R}^2$) penalizes the R-squared metric for increasing number of predictors. 

$$\bar{R}^2 = 1 - \frac{SSE}{SST} \cdot \frac{n-1}{n-k-1}$$

```{r collapse=TRUE}
(adj_r2 <- 1 - sse/sst * (n - 1) / (n - k - 1))

summary(fit)$adj.r.squared
```

#### RMSE, RSE, MAE

The root mean squared error (**RMSE**) is the average prediction error (square root of mean squared error).

$$RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n{(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}}{n}}$$

```{r collapse=TRUE}
sqrt(mean((mt_cars$mpg - fit$fitted.values)^2))
augment(fit) %>% yardstick::rmse(truth = mpg, estimate = .fitted)
```

The mean squared error of a model with theoretical residual of mean zero and constant variance $\sigma^2$ can be decomposed into the model's bias and the model's variance:

$$E[MSE] = \sigma^2 + Bias^2 + Var.$$

A model that predicts the response closely will have low bias, but be relatively sensitive to the training data and thus have high variance.  A model that predicts the response conservatively (e.g., a simple mean) will have large bias, but be relatively insensitive to nuances in the training data.  Here is an example of a simulated sine wave.  A model predicting the mean value at the upper and lower levels has low variance, but high bias, and a model of an actual sine wave has low bias and high variance.  This is the variance-bias trade-off. 

```{r warning=FALSE, fig.height=3}
data.frame(x = seq(2, 10, 0.1)) %>%
  mutate(
    e = runif(81, -.5, .5),
    y = sin(x) + e,
    `Low var, high bias` = zoo:::rollmean(y, k = 3, fill = NA, align = "center"),
    `High var, low bias` = sin(x)
  ) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = `Low var, high bias`:`High var, low bias`) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = y)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = value, color = name), size = 1)
```

The residual standard error (**RSE**, or model sigma $\hat{\sigma}$) is an estimate of the standard deviation of $\epsilon$. It is roughly the average amount the response deviates from the true regression line.  

$$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n{(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}}{n-k-1}}$$

```{r collapse=TRUE}
sqrt(sum((mt_cars$mpg - fit$fitted.values)^2) / (n - k - 1))

# sd is sqrt(sse / (n-1)), sigma = sqrt(sse / (n - k - 1))
sd(fit$residuals) * sqrt((n - 1) / (n - k - 1))  

summary(fit)$sigma 

sigma(fit)
```

The mean absolute error (**MAE**) is the average absolute prediction arror.  It is less sensitive to outliers.

$$MAE = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n{|y_i - \hat{y}_i|}}{n}$$

```{r}
sum(abs(mt_cars$mpg - fit$fitted.values)) / n
```

These metrics are good for evaluating a model, but less useful for comparing models. The problem is that they tend to improve with additional variables added to the model, even if the improvement is not significant. The following metrics aid model comparison by penalizing added variables. 

#### AIC, BIC

Akaike's Information Criteria (**AIC**) is a penalization metric.  The lower the AIC, the better the model.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
AIC(fit)
# AICc corrects AIC for small sample sizes.
AIC(fit) + (2 * k * (k + 1)) / (n - k - 1)
```

The Bayesian information criteria (**BIC**) is like AIC, but with a stronger penalty for additional variables.

```{r}
BIC(fit)
```

`broom::glance()` calculates many validation metrics. Compare the full model to a reduced model without `cyl`.

```{r}
broom::glance(fit) %>% select(adj.r.squared, sigma, AIC, BIC, p.value)
glance(lm(mpg ~ . - cyl, mt_cars)) %>% select(adj.r.squared, sigma, AIC, BIC, p.value)
```

The adjusted R2 increased and AIC and BIC decreased, meaning the full model is less efficient at explaining the variability in the response value.  The residual standard error `sigma` is smaller for the reduced model.  Finally, the *F* statistic p-value is smaller for the reduced model, meaning the reduced model is statistically more significant.

Note that these regression metrics are all internal measures, that is they have been computed on the training dataset, not the test dataset.

### Cross-Validation

Cross-validation is a set of methods for measuring the performance of a predictive model on a test dataset.  The main measures of prediction performance are R2, RMSE and MAE. 

#### Validation Set

To perform validation set cross validation, randomly split the data into a training data set and a test data set. Fit models to the training data set, then predict values with the validation set. The model that produces the best prediction performance is the preferred model.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
set.seed(123)

mt_cars_split <- initial_split(mt_cars, prop = 0.7, strata = mpg)
mt_cars_training <- mt_cars_split %>% training()
mt_cars_testing <- mt_cars_split %>% testing()

fit_validation <- linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lm") %>% 
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  fit(mpg ~ ., data = mt_cars_training) %>%
  predict(new_data = mt_cars_testing) %>%
  bind_cols(mt_cars_testing)

fit_validation %>% rmse(truth = mpg, estimate = .pred)
fit_validation %>% rsq(truth = mpg, estimate = .pred)
```

Alternatively, `last_fit()` i) splits train/test, ii) fits, and iii) predicts.

```{r eval=FALSE}
fit_validation_2 <- linear_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("lm") %>% 
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  last_fit(mpg ~ ., split = mt_cars_split)
fit_validation_2 %>% collect_metrics()
fit_validation_2 %>% collect_predictions()
```

The validation set method is only useful when you have a large data set to partition.  A second disadvantage is that building a model on a fraction of the data leaves out information. The test error will vary with which observations are included in the training set.

#### LOOCV

Leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) works by successively modeling with training sets leaving out one data point, then averaging the prediction errors.

```{r eval=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
m2 <- train(mpg ~ ., 
            data = d.train[, 1:9],
            method = "lm",
            trControl = trainControl(method = "LOOCV"))
print(m2)
postResample(pred = predict(m2, newdata = d.test), 
             obs = d.test$mpg)
```

This method isn't perfect either.  It repeats as many times as there are data points, so the execution time may be long.  LOOCV is also sensitive to outliers.

#### K-fold Cross-Validation

K-fold cross-validation splits the dataset into *k* folds (subsets), then uses *k-1* of the folds for a training set and the remaining fold for a test set, then repeats for all permutations of k taken k-1 at a time.  E.g., 3-fold cross-validation will partition the data into sets A, B, and C, then create train/test splits of [AB, C], [AC, B], and [BC, A].  

K-fold cross-validation is less computationally expensive than LOOCV, and often yields more accurate test error rate estimates.  What is the right value of k?  The lower is *k* the more biased the estimates; the higher is *k* the larger the estimate variability. At the extremes *k* = 2 is the validation set method, and *k = n* is the LOOCV method.  In practice, one typically performs k-fold cross-validation using k = 5 or k = 10 because these values have been empirically shown to balence bias and variance. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
m3 <- train(mpg ~ ., 
            data = d.train[, 1:9],
            method = "lm",
            trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                                     number = 5))
print(m3)
postResample(pred = predict(m3, newdata = d.test), 
             obs = d.test$mpg)
```

#### Repeated K-fold CV

You can also perform k-fold cross-validation multiple times and average the results.  Specify `method = "repeatedcv"` and `repeats = 3` in the `trainControl` object for three repeats.

```{r eval=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
m4 <- train(mpg ~ ., 
            data = d.train[, 1:9],
            method = "lm",
            trControl = trainControl(method = "repeatedcv",
                                     number = 5,
                                     repeats = 3))
print(m4)
postResample(pred = predict(m4, newdata = d.test), 
             obs = d.test$mpg)
```


#### Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping randomly selects a sample of n observations with replacement from the original dataset to evaluate the model.  The procedure is repeated many times.

Specify `method = "boot"` and `number = 100` to perform 100 bootstrap samples.

```{r eval=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
m5 <- train(mpg ~ ., 
            data = d.train[, 1:9],
            method = "lm",
            trControl = trainControl(method = "boot",
                                     number = 100))
print(m5)
postResample(pred = predict(m5, newdata = d.test), 
             obs = d.test$mpg)
```


### Gain Curve

For supervised learning purposes, a visual way to evaluate a regression model is with the gain curve.  This visualization compares a predictive model score to an actual outcome (either binary (0/1) or continuous). The gain curve plot measures how well the model score sorts the data compared to the true outcome value.  The x-axis is the fraction of items seen when sorted by score, and the y-axis is the cumulative summed true outcome when sorted by score.  For comparison, GainCurvePlot also plots the "wizard curve": the gain curve when the data is sorted according to its true outcome.  A relative Gini score close to 1 means the model sorts responses well.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
fit_validation %>%
  WVPlots::GainCurvePlot(xvar = ".pred", truthVar = "mpg", title = "Model Gain Curve")
```

# Generalized Linear Models (GLM)

tidymodels_prefer()

theme_set(
  theme_light() +
    theme(
      plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0),

    )
)
```

The linear regression model, $E(y|X) = X \beta$, structured as $y_i = X_i \beta + \epsilon_i$ where $X_i \beta = \mu_i$, assumes the response is a linear function of the predictors and the residuals are independent random variables normally distributed with zero mean and constant variance, $\epsilon \sim N \left(0, \sigma^2 \right)$. This implies that given a set of predictors, the response is normally distributed about its expected value, $y_i \sim N \left(\mu_i, \sigma^2 \right)$. However, there are many situations where this normality assumption does not hold. Generalized linear models (GLMs) are a generalization of the linear regression model that work with non-normal response distributions.^[These notes are primarily from PSU's [Analysis of Discrete Data](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat504) which uses Alan Agresti's **Categorical Data Analysis** [@Agresti2013]. I also reviewed PSU's [Regression Methods](https://newonlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat501/lesson/15), DataCamp's [Generalized Linear Models in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/generalized-linear-models-in-r), DataCamp's [Multiple and Logistic Regression](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/multiple-and-logistic-regression), and **Interpretable machine learning** [@Molner2020].]

The response will not have a normal distribution if the underlying data-generating process is binomial (Section \@ref(binomiallogistic)) or multinomial (Section \@ref(multinomiallogistic)), ordinal (Section \@ref(ordinallogistic)), Poisson (counts, Section \@ref(poissonregression)), or exponential (time-to-event). In these situations the linear regression model can predict probabilities and proportions outside [0, 1], or negative counts or times. GLMs solve this problem by modeling a *function* of the expected value of $y$, $f(E(y|X)) = X \beta$. There are three components to a GLM: a *random component* specified by the response variable's probability distribution (normal, binomial, etc.); a *systematic component* in the form $X\beta$; and a *link function*, $\eta$, that specifies the link between the random and systematic components and converts the response to a range of $[-\infty, +\infty]$.  

Linear regression is a special case of GLM where the link function is the identity function, $f(E(y|X)) = E(y|X)$. For binary logistic regression, the link function is the logit,

$$f(E(y|X)) = \log \left( \frac{E(y|X)}{1 - E(y|X)} \right) = \log \left( \frac{\pi}{1 - \pi} \right) = \mathrm{logit}(\pi)$$

where $\pi$ is the response probability.^[The related probit regression link function is $f(E(Y|X)) = \Phi^{-1}(E(Y|X)) = \Phi^{-1}(\pi)$. The difference between the logistic and probit link function is theoretical, and [the practical significance is slight](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/the-difference-between-logistic-and-probit-regression/). You can safely ignore probit.] For multinomial logistic regression, the link function is the logit again, but with respect to the baseline level, and there is set of logits (one for each non-baseline level),

$$f(E(y|X)) = \log \left( \frac{E(y_j|X)}{E(y_{j^*}|X)} \right) = \log \left( \frac{\pi_j}{\pi_{j^*}} \right) = \mathrm{logit}(\pi_j)$$

Where $j$ is a level in the dependent variable and $j^*$ is the baseline level. For Poisson regression, the link function is

$$f(E(y|X)) = \ln (E(y|X)) = \ln(\lambda)$$

where $\lambda$ is the expected event rate. For exponential regression, the link function is 

$$f(E(y|X) = -E(y|X) = -\lambda$$

where $\lambda$ is the expected time to event.

GLM uses maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) rather than ordinary least squares (OLS) to estimate the parameters, and thus relies on large-sample approximations. 

Fit a GLM just like an linear model, but with the `glm()` function, specifying the distribution with the `family = c("gaussian", "binomial", "poisson")` parameter. Fit a mulinomial logistic regression model with `nnet::multinom()`.

## Binomial Logistic Regression {#binomiallogistic}

Logistic regression estimates the probability that a categorical dependent variable is a particular level. The dependent variable levels can be binomial, multinomial, or ordinal. The *binary* logistic regression model is

$$y_i = \mathrm{logit}(\pi_i) = \log \left( \frac{\pi_i}{1 - \pi_i} \right) = X_i \beta$$

where $\pi_i$ is the response $i$'s binary level probability. The model predicts the *log odds* of the level. Why do this? The range of outcomes need to be between 0 and 1, and a sigmoid function, $f(y) = 1 / \left(1 + e^y \right)$, does that. If the _log odds_ of the level equals $X_i\beta$, then the _odds_ of the level equals $e^{X\beta}$. You can solve for $\pi_i$ to get $\pi = \mathrm{odds} / (\mathrm{odds} + 1)$. Substituting, 

$$\pi_i = \frac{\exp(y_i)}{1 + \exp(y_i)} = \frac{e^{X_i\beta}}{1 + e^{X_i\beta}}$$

which you can simplify to $\pi_i = 1 / (1 + e^{-X_i\beta})$, a sigmoid function. The upshot is $X\beta$ is the functional relationship between the independent variables and _a function of the response_, not the response itself.

The model parameters are estimated either by _iteratively reweighted least squares optimization_ or by _maximum likelihood estimation_ (MLE). MLE maximizes the probability produced by a set of parameters $\beta$ given a data set and probability distribution.^[Notes from [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/logistic-regression-with-maximum-likelihood-estimation/).] In logistic regression the probability distribution is the binomial and each observation is the outcome of a single Bernoulli trial. 

$$L(\beta; y, X) = \prod_{i=1}^n \pi_i^{y_i}(1 - \pi_i)^{(1-y_i)} = \prod_{i=1}^n\frac{\exp(y_i X_i \beta)}{1 + \exp(X_i \beta)}.$$

In practice, multiplying many small probabilities can be unstable, so MLE optimizes the log likelihood instead. 

$$\begin{align}
l(\beta; y, X) &= \sum_{i = 1}^n \left(y_i \log(\pi_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \pi_i) \right) \\
               &= \sum_{i = 1}^n \left(y_i X_i \beta - \log(1 + e^{X_i\beta}) \right)
\end{align}$$

Sometimes you will see the _cost function_ optimized. The cost function is the negative of of the log likelihood function.

**Assumptions**

The binomial logistic regression model requires a dichotomous dependent variable and independent observations. The sample size should be large, at least 10 observations per dependent variable level and independent variable. There are three conditions related to the data distribution: i) the logit transformation must be linearly related to any continuous independent variables, ii) there must be no multicollinearity, and iii) there must be no influential outliers.

Be aware of over-dispersion, a common issue with GLM. For a binomial logistic regression, the response variable should be distributed $y_i \sim \mathrm{Bin}(n_i, \pi_i)$ with $\mu_i = n_i \pi_i$ and $\sigma^2 = \pi (1 - \pi)$. Over-dispersion means the data shows evidence of variance greater than $\sigma^2$.

### Case Study {.unnumbered #cs1}

This case study uses the [Laerd Statistics](https://statistics.laerd.com/) article on binomial logistic regression [data set](https://statistics.laerd.com/premium/spss/spss-files/logistic-regression.sav). A study investigates the relationship between the incidence of heart disease (Yes|No) and age, weight, gender, and maximal aerobic capacity using data from *n* = 100 participants.

```{r}
cs1 <- list()

cs1$dat <- foreign::read.spss("./input/logistic-regression.sav", to.data.frame = TRUE)

cs1$dat %>%
  gtsummary::tbl_summary(
    by = heart_disease,
    include = -caseno,
    percent = "row",
    statistic = list(gtsummary::all_continuous() ~ "{mean}, {sd}")
  )
```

<br>

Overall, men are twice as likely to have heart disease. Male odds are .43/.57 = `r comma(.43/.57, .1)` and female odds are .22/.78 = `r comma(.22/.78, .1)`, an male-to-female odds ratio of `r comma((.43/.57) / (.22/.78), .1)`.

```{r}
cs1$dat %>% gtsummary::tbl_cross(row = heart_disease, col = gender, percent = "col") 
```

Age, weight, and poor max aerobic capacity are positively associated with heart disease.

```{r}
cs1$dat %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(age, weight, VO2max)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = heart_disease, y = value)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = name)) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(name), scales = "free_y")
```

:::rmdnote
Consider centering the continuous variables around their means to facilitate model interpretation. The intercept term in the fitted model would represent a reasonable condition, not a zero-aged, zero-weighted person with no aerobic capacity. This is the way to go if you want to present your findings in the framework of a baseline probability (or odds) and the incremental effects of the independent variables. You might also standardize the continuous vars to get a more meaningful increment. On the other hand, if you want to use your model for predicting outcomes, you'll have to back out of the centering when you predict values.
:::

If your model is predictive rather than inferential, split the data into training/testing data sets.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
# For reproducibility
set.seed(123)

(x <- initial_split(cs1$dat, prop = 0.7, strata = heart_disease))

cs1$dat_training <- training(x)
dim(cs1$dat_training)

cs1$dat_testing <- testing(x)
dim(cs1$dat_testing)
```

### Fit the Model {-}

Fit the model using the tidymodels framework. If you want to continue using the classic methodology, the glm object is inside the tidymodels fit. The model fit returns a brief summary with the coefficients and model diagnostics. 

```{r}
cs1$model <- 
  logistic_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("glm") %>% 
  set_mode("classification") 

cs1$fit <-
  cs1$model %>%
  fit(heart_disease ~ age + weight + VO2max + gender, data = cs1$dat)

# The fit object returned by glm(). You'll need this for interpretation and 
# checking assumptions.
cs1$result <-
  cs1$fit %>%
  extract_fit_engine()

# If you are fitting a predictive model, use the training set.
cs1$fit_training <-
  cs1$model %>%
  fit(heart_disease ~ age + weight + VO2max + gender, data = cs1$dat_training)

cs1$result %>% summary()
```

The null deviance, G^2, is the likelihood ratio of the intercept-only model with `r nrow(cs1$dat_training)` rows - 1 parameter = `r cs1$result %>% summary() %>% .$df.null` degrees of freedom. It is the sum of the squared deviance residuals. The residual deviance is the likelihood ratio of the full model with `r nrow(cs1$dat)` - 5 parameters = `r cs1$result %>% summary() %>% .$df.residual` degrees of freedom. 

The residual deviance is distributed chi-squared and can be used to test whether the model differs from the saturated model (model with as many coefficients as observations, G^2 = 0, *df* = 0) where $H_0$ = no difference. The deviance test for lack of fit fails to reject the null hypothesis.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
# G^2 calculations
cs1$result %>% residuals(type = "deviance") %>% .^2 %>% sum()
cs1$result %>% deviance()

# df
df.residual(cs1$result)

# G^2 is distributed chi-squared with df degrees of freedom
pchisq(deviance(cs1$result), df = df.residual(cs1$result), lower.tail = FALSE)
vcdExtra::LRstats(cs1$result)
```

These two deviances, the null and residual, are shown in the ANOVA summary. An ANOVA table shows the change in deviance from successively adding each variable to the model.

```{r}
anova(cs1$result)
```

Deviance residuals are one of four residuals you can calculate from a binary logistic regression.^[[UVA](https://data.library.virginia.edu/understanding-deviance-residuals/) discusses the four types of residuals you can calculate from a binary logistic regression.] One is the *raw residual*, $\epsilon_i = y_i - \hat{p}_i$, where $\hat{p}_i$ is the predicted probability. Another is the *Pearson residual*, $r_i = \frac{\epsilon_i}{\sqrt{\hat{p}_i(1 - \hat{p}_i)}}$, the raw residual rescaled by dividing by the estimated standard deviation of a binomial distribution with 1 trial^[See probability notes on the binomial distribution [here](https://bookdown.org/mpfoley1973/probability/binomial.html)]. A third is the *standardized Pearson residual*, $rs_i = r_i / \sqrt{1 - \hat{h}_i}$, the Pearson residual adjusted for the leverage of the predictors using the hat-values. Hat-values measure the predictor distances from the mean. This residual is especially useful to evaluate model fit because if the model fits well, these residuals have a standard normal distribution. Finally, there are the *deviance residuals*, $d_i = \mathrm{sign}(\epsilon_i) \left[ -2(y_i \log \hat{p}_i + (1 - y_i) \log (1 - \hat{p}_i)) \right]^{.5}$. Deviance Residuals measure how much the estimated probabilities differ from the observed proportions of success. You want deviance residuals to be evenly distributed (in absolute values, 1Q $\approx$ 3Q, min $\approx$ max). You also want the min and max to be <3 because deviance residuals are roughly approximated by a standard normal distribution.

```{r}
bind_rows(
  Raw = cs1$result %>% residuals(type = "response") %>% summary(),
  Pearson = cs1$result %>% residuals(type = "pearson") %>% summary(),
  `Standardized Pearson` = cs1$result %>% rstandard(type = "pearson") %>% summary(),
  Deviance = cs1$result %>% residuals(type = "deviance") %>% summary(),
  .id = "Residual"
)
```

### Interpretation {-}

Before we look at the coefficient estimations, consider what it is they are predicting: the log odds of the binary response. To see what that means, plug in values for the explanatory variables to get predictions. $\hat{y}$ is the log odds of having heart disease. 

```{r collapse=TRUE}
(mean_person <- 
  cs1$dat %>%
  select(-caseno) %>%
  summarize(.by = gender, across(where(is.numeric), mean)))

pred_log_odds <- cs1$fit %>% predict(new_data = mean_person, type = "raw")
names(pred_log_odds) <- mean_person$gender
pred_log_odds
```

Exponentiate to get the **odds**, $\exp (\hat{y}) = \frac{\pi}{1 - \pi}$.

```{r}
(pred_odds <- exp(pred_log_odds))
```

Solve for $\pi = \frac{\exp (\hat{y})}{1 + \exp (\hat{y})}$ to get the **probability**. Do the math, or use `predict(type = "prob")`.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
(pred_prob <- pred_odds / (1 + pred_odds))
cs1$fit %>% predict(new_data = mean_person, type = "prob")
```

Now let's interpret the coefficients.

```{r}
cs1$fit %>% tidy()
```

The intercept term is the log-odds of heart disease for the reference case. The reference case in the model is `gender` = "Female", `age` = 0, `weight` = 0, and `VO2max` = 0. If the data was centered, the reference case would actually meaningful.

```{r}
cs1$fit %>%
  predict(new_data = list(age = 0, weight = 0, VO2max = 0, gender = "Female"), 
          type = "raw")
```

Column "statistic" is the Wald $z$ statistic, $z = \hat{\beta} / SE(\hat{\beta})$. Its square is the Wald chi-squared statistic. The _p_-value is the area to the right of $z^2$ in the $\chi_1^2$ density curve:

```{r}
cs1$fit %>% 
  tidy() %>%
  mutate(p.chisq = map_dbl(statistic, ~pchisq(.^2, df = 1, lower.tail = FALSE))) %>%
  pull(p.chisq)
```

Interpret the coefficient estimates as the change in the log odds of $y$ due to a one unit change in $x$. If $\delta = x_a - x_b$, then a $\delta$ change in $x$ is associated with a $\delta \hat{\beta}$ change in the log odds of $y$. $\beta$ is the log odds ratio of $x_a$ vs $x_b$.

$$\log \left(\pi / (1 - \pi) |_{x = x_a} \right) - \log \left(\pi / (1 - \pi) |_{x = x_b} \right) = \log \left( \frac{\pi / (1 - \pi) |_{x = x_a}}{\pi / (1 - \pi) |_{x = x_b}} \right) = \delta \hat{\beta}$$

The *exponential* of the coefficient estimates is the change in the _odds_ of $y$ due to a $\delta$ change in $x$. $\exp \beta$ is the odds ratio of $x_a$ vs $x_b$.

$$\mathrm{odds}(y) = e^{\delta \hat{\beta}}$$

```{r}
cs1$fit %>% tidy(exponentiate = TRUE)
```

All covariates held equal, a male's log odds of heart disease are `r comma(coefficients(cs1$result)["genderMale"], .01)` times that of a female's (log(OR)). A male's odds are `r comma(exp(coefficients(cs1$result)["genderMale"]), .01)` times that of a female's (OR). Of course, all covariate's are _not_ equal - males are heavier and have higher VO2max. Let's run the calculations with the mean predictor values for male and female.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
# Log OR
pred_log_odds["Male"] / pred_log_odds["Female"]

# OR
pred_odds["Male"] / pred_odds["Female"]
```

A one-unit increase in any of the continuous independent variables is interpreted similarly. The reference level is unimportant since the change is constant across the range of values. A one year increase in age increases the log-odds of heart disease by a factor of `r comma(coefficients(cs1$result)["age"], .01)`, and the odds by a factor of `r comma(exp(coefficients(cs1$result)["age"]), .01)`. To calculate the effect of a *decade* increase in age, multiply $\beta$ by 10 before exponentiating, or raise the exponentiated coeficient by 10. The effect of a 10-year increase in age is to increase the odds of heart disease by `r comma(exp(coefficients(cs1$result)["age"] * 10), .01)`. The odds double every ten years.

`oddsratio::or_glm()` is a handy way to calculate odds ratios from arbitrary increments to the predictors. Here are the ORs of a 10-year age change, 10 kg weight change, and VO2max change of 5.

```{r}
oddsratio::or_glm(
  cs1$dat, 
  cs1$result, 
  incr = list(age = 10, weight = 25, VO2max = -12)
)
```

Notice that the predicted probabilities have the sigmoidal shape of the binary relationship.

```{r message=FALSE}
augment(cs1$fit, new_data = cs1$dat, type = "raw") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, color = gender)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = as.numeric(heart_disease == "Yes"))) +
  geom_point(aes(y = .pred_Yes), shape = 4) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = .pred_Yes), se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Age",
       y = NULL,
       title = "Binary Fitted Line Plot") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,1), labels = c("Healthy", "Heart Disease")) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```

### Assumptions {-}

Four assumptions relate to the study design: (1) the dependent variable is dichotomous; (2) the observations are independent; (3) the categories of all nominal variables are mutually exclusive and exhaustive; and (4) there are at least 10 observations per dependent variable level and independent variable. These assumptions are all valid here. Three more assumptions related to the data distribution: 

- There is a linear relationship between the logit transformation and the continuous independent variables. Test with a plot and with Box-Tidwell.

- There is no independent variable multicollinearity. Test with correlation coefficients and variance inflation factors (VIF).

- There are no influential outliers. Test with Cook's distance. 

Test the linearity assumption first. There are two ways to do this (do both). First, fit your model, then plot the _fitted values_ against the continuous predictors. This is the GLM analog to OLS bivariate analysis, except now the dependent variable is the _logit_ transformation. These plotted relationships look pretty linear.

```{r}
cs1$fit %>%
  augment(new_data = cs1$dat) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(age, weight, VO2max)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = .pred_Yes)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(name), scales = "free_x") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y~x") +
  labs(title = "Linearity Test: predicted vs continuous predictors", x = NULL)
```

The second test for linearity is the Box-Tidwell approach. Add transformations of the continuous independent variables to the model, $x_{Tx} = x \log x$, then test their significance level in the fit.

```{r}
# Using non-centered vars to avoid log(0) errors.
x <- 
  cs1$dat %>%
  mutate(
    age_tx = log(age) * age,
    weight_tx = log(weight) * weight,
    VO2max_tx = log(VO2max) * VO2max
  )

cs1$boxtidwell_fit <- 
  logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  fit(heart_disease ~ age + weight + VO2max + gender + 
        age_tx + weight_tx + VO2max_tx, 
      data = x)

cs1$boxtidwell_fit %>% tidy()
```

Focus on the three transformed variables. `age_tx` is the only one with a *p*-value nearly <.05, but it is customary to apply a Bonferroni adjustment when testing for linearity. There are eight predictors in the model (including the intercept term), so the Bonferroni adjusted *p*-value for `age_tx` is multiplied by 8. Do not reject the null hypothesis of linearity.

If the relationship _was_ nonlinear, you could try transforming the variable by raising it to $\lambda = 1 + b / \gamma$ where $b$ is the estimated coefficient of the model without the interaction terms, and $\gamma$ is the estimated coefficient of the interaction term of the model with interactions. For `age`, $b$ is `r comma(coefficients(cs1$result)["age"], .001)` and $\gamma$ is `r comma(coefficients(cs1$boxtidwell_fit$fit)["age_tx"], .001)`, so $\lambda$ = `r comma(1 + coefficients(cs1$fit$fit)["age"] / coefficients(cs1$boxtidwell_fit$fit)["age_tx"], .001)`. This is approximately 1 (no transformation). It appears to be customary to apply general transformations like .5 (square root), 1/3 (cube root), ln, and the reciprocal.

Now check for multicollinearity. Variance inflation factors (VIF) estimate how much the variance of a regression coefficient is inflated due to multicollinearity. When independent variables are correlated, it is difficult to say which variable really influences the dependent variable. The VIF for variable $i$ is

$$
\mathrm{VIF}_i = \frac{1}{1 - R_i^2}
$$

where $R_i^2$ is the coefficient of determination (i.e., the proportion of dependent variance explained by the model) of a regression of $X_i$ against all of the other predictors, $X_i = X_{j \ne i} \beta + \epsilon$. If $X_i$ is totally unrelated to its covariates, then $R_i^2$ will be zero and $\mathrm{VIF}_i$ will be 1. If $R_i^2$ is .8, $\mathrm{VIF}_i$ will be 5. The rule of thumb is that $R_i^2 \le 5$ is tolerable, and $R_i^2 > 5$ is "highly correlated" and you have to do something about it. These are excellent.

```{r}
car::vif(cs1$result)
```

Try calculating the $\mathrm{VIF}$ for `age`.

:::rmdnote
I don't know why this doesn't work. It _would_ work if the underlying model was OLS instead of GLM. The answer seems to be related to GVIF vs VIF, but I didn't figure it out.)
:::

```{r collapse=TRUE}
r2 <- lm(age ~ weight + VO2max + gender, data = cs1$dat_training) %>%
  summary() %>% pluck("r.squared")

(vif <- 1 / (1 - r2))
```

```{r include=FALSE}
cs1$outliers <- 
  cs1$result %>% 
  augment(type.predict = "response") %>% 
  filter(abs(.std.resid) >= 2) %>% 
  pull(.std.resid)
```

Now check for influential outliers. Predict the response probabilities and filter for the predictions more than two standard deviations from the actual value and a Cook's Distance greater than 4/N = `r 4 / nrow(cs1$dat)`.^[[This article](https://towardsdatascience.com/assumptions-of-logistic-regression-clearly-explained-44d85a22b290) suggests using three standard deviations for an outliers threshold.] Cook's distance measures how much predicted values change when observation *i* is removed from the data. Only two fitted values were both an outlier and influential, row ids 59 and 70. An index plot of Cook's Distance shows the two points at the far left. You might examine the observations for validity. Otherwise, proceed and explain that there were two standardized residuals with value of `r comma(cs1$outliers[1], .01)` and `r comma(cs1$outliers[2], .01)` standard deviations which were kept in the analysis. 

```{r warning=FALSE}
augment(cs1$result) %>%

    id = row_number(),
    outlier = if_else(abs(.std.resid) >= 2, "Outlier", "Other"),

    status = case_when(
      outlier == "Outlier" & influential == "Influential" ~ "Influential Outlier",
      outlier == "Outlier" ~ "Outlier",
      influential == "Influential" ~ "Influential",
      TRUE ~ "Other"
    )
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, y = .cooksd)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = status)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = if_else(influential == "Influential", id, NA_integer_)), 
            check_overlap = TRUE, size = 3, nudge_x = .025) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 4 / nrow(cs1$dat), linetype = 2, color = "goldenrod") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Influential Outlier" = "firebrick", 
                                "Influential" = "goldenrod",
                                "Outlier" = "slategray",
                                "Other" = "black")) +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  labs(title = "Index Plot of Cook's Distance.",
       subtitle = "Row id labeled for values > 4 / N.")
```

### Evaluate the Fit {-}

There are several ways to evaluate the model fit. 

- The likelihood ratio test
- Pseudo R-squared^[Nice explanation [here](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/faq/general/faq-what-are-pseudo-r-squareds/). Sounds like you should use pseudo R2 for model comparison, not for reporting goodness of fit].
- Accuracy measures
- Gain and ROC curves

The **likelihood ratio test** compares the log likelihood of the fitted model to an intercept-only model.

```{r}
intercept_only <-
  logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  fit(heart_disease ~ 1, data = cs1$dat)

(cs1$lrtest <- lmtest::lrtest(cs1$result, intercept_only$fit))
```

The fitted model is significant, $\chi^2$(`r abs(cs1$lrtest$Df[2])`) = `r comma(cs1$lrtest$Chisq[2], .1)`, *p* < .001. Calculate the pseuedo-R2 with `DescTools::PseudoR2()`.

:::rmdnote
I Can't get this to work in the tidymodels framework. Using `glm()` for now.
:::

```{r}
x <- glm(heart_disease ~ age + weight + VO2max + gender, 
         data = cs1$dat,
         family = "binomial")
cs1$pseudo_r2 <- DescTools::PseudoR2(x, which = c("CoxSnell", "Nagelkerke", "McFadden"))

cs1$pseudo_r2
```

Laerd interprets this as the model explained `r percent(cs1$pseudo_r2["Nagelkerke"], .1)` (Nagelkerke R2) of the variance in heart disease. This is how your would interpret R2 in an OLS model. [UCLA](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/faq/general/faq-what-are-pseudo-r-squareds/) points out that the various pseudo R-squareds measure other aspects of the model and are unique to the measured quantity. A pseudo R-squared is not very informative on its own; it is useful for comparing models. Accuracy measures formed by the cross-tabulation of observed and predicted classes is the better way to go.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
cs1$conf_mat <-
  cs1$fit %>% 
  augment(new_data = cs1$dat) %>%
  # conf_mat requires truth to be first level of the factor variable.
  mutate(across(c(heart_disease, .pred_class), ~fct_relevel(., "Yes"))) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = heart_disease, estimate = .pred_class)

cs1$conf_mat

cs1$conf_mat %>% summary()

cs1$conf_mat %>% autoplot()
```

The model accuracy, `r cs1$conf_mat %>% summary() %>% filter(.metric == "accuracy") %>% pull(.estimate) %>% percent(.1)`, is the percent of observations correctly classified. The sensitivity, `r cs1$conf_mat %>% summary() %>% filter(.metric == "sens") %>% pull(.estimate) %>% percent(.1)`, is the accuracy with regard to predicting positive cases. The specificity, `r cs1$conf_mat %>% summary() %>% filter(.metric == "spec") %>% pull(.estimate) %>% percent(.1)`, is the accuracy with regard to predicting negative cases. If you are fitting a predictive model, use the testing data set for this.

```{r}
cs1$fit_training %>% 
  augment(new_data = cs1$dat_testing) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = heart_disease, estimate = .pred_class)
```

Finally, plot the [gain curve or ROC curve](https://community.tibco.com/wiki/gains-vs-roc-curves-do-you-understand-difference). In the **gain curve**, the x-axis is the fraction of items seen when sorted by the predicted value, and the y-axis is the cumulatively summed true outcome. The "wizard" curve is the gain curve when the data is sorted by the true outcome.  If the model's gain curve is close to the wizard curve, then the model predicts the response well. The gray area is the "gain" over a random prediction.

```{r}
cs1$dat_testing %>%
  bind_cols(predict(cs1$fit, new_data = cs1$dat_testing, type = "prob")) %>%
  # event_level = "second" sets the second level as success
  yardstick::gain_curve(.pred_Yes, truth = heart_disease, event_level = "second") %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(title = "Gain Curve")
```

`r sum(cs1$dat_testing$heart_disease == "Yes")` of the `r nrow(cs1$dat_testing)` participants had heart disease in the test data set. 

- The gain curve encountered 6 heart disease cases (50%) within the first 8 observations (55%). It encountered all 11 heart disease cases on the 18th observation.
- The bottom of the grey area is the outcome of a random model. Only half the heart disease cases would be observed within 50% of the observations.  
- The top of the grey area is the outcome of the perfect model, the "wizard curve". Half the heart disease cases would be observed in 6/30=20% of the observations.

The **ROC** (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve plots sensitivity vs specificity at varying cut-off values for the probability ranging from 0 to 1. Ideally, you want very little trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, with a curve hugging the left and top axes.

```{r}
cs1$dat_testing %>%
  bind_cols(predict(cs1$fit, new_data = cs1$dat_testing, type = "prob")) %>%
  # event_level = "second" sets the second level as success
  yardstick::roc_curve(.pred_Yes, truth = heart_disease, event_level = "second") %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(title = "ROC Curve")
```

### Reporting {-}

> A binomial logistic regression was performed to ascertain the effects of age, weight, gender and VO2max on the likelihood that participants have heart disease. Linearity of the continuous variables with respect to the logit of the dependent variable was assessed via the Box-Tidwell (1962) procedure. A Bonferroni correction was applied using all eight terms in the model resulting in statistical significance being accepted when *p* < `r comma(.05/8, .00001)` (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2014). Based on this assessment, all continuous independent variables were found to be linearly related to the logit of the dependent variable. There were two standardized residuals with value of `r comma(cs1$outliers[1], .01)` and `r comma(cs1$outliers[2], .01)` standard deviations, which were kept in the analysis. The logistic regression model was statistically significant, χ2(4) = 27.40, p < .001. The model explained `r percent(cs1$pseudo_r2["Nagelkerke"], .1)` (Nagelkerke R2) of the variance in heart disease and correctly classified `r cs1$conf_mat %>% summary() %>% filter(.metric == "accuracy") %>% pull(.estimate) %>% percent(.1)` of cases. Sensitivity was `r cs1$conf_mat %>% summary() %>% filter(.metric == "sens") %>% pull(.estimate) %>% percent(.1)`, specificity was `r cs1$conf_mat %>% summary() %>% filter(.metric == "spec") %>% pull(.estimate) %>% percent(.1)`, positive predictive value was `r percent(cs1$confusion_matrix$byClass["Pos Pred Value"], .1)` and negative predictive value was `r percent(cs1$confusion_matrix$byClass["Neg Pred Value"], .1)`. Of the five predictor variables only three were statistically significant: age, gender and VO2max (as shown in Table 1). Females had `r exp(-coef(cs1$result)["genderMale"]) %>% comma(.01)` times lower odds to exhibit heart disease than males. Increasing age was associated with an increased likelihood of exhibiting heart disease, but increasing VO2max was associated with a reduction in the likelihood of exhibiting heart disease.

## Multinomial Logistic Regression {#multinomiallogistic}

The _multinomial_ logistic regression model is $J - 1$ baseline logits,

$$y_i = \log \left( \frac{\pi_{ij}}{\pi_{ij^*}} \right) = X_i \beta_j, \hspace{5mm} j \ne j^*$$

where $j$ is a level of the multinomial response variable. Whereas binomial logistic regression models the *log odds* of the response level, multinomial logistic regression models the *log relative risk*, the probability relative to the baseline $j^*$ level.^[These notes rely on the course notes from [PSU STAT 504, Analysis of Discrete Data](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat504/) and [UCLA](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/dae/multinomial-logistic-regression/).]

Interpret the $k^{th}$ element of $\beta_j$ as the increase in log  relative risk of $Y_i = j$ relative to $Y_i = j^*$ given a one-unit increase in the $k^{th}$ element of $X$, holding the other terms constant. The individual probabilities, $\pi_{ij}$, are

$$\pi_{ij} = \frac{\exp(y_{ij})}{1 + \sum_{j \ne j^*} \exp(y_{ij})} = \frac{e^{X_i\beta_j}}{1 + \sum_{j \ne j^*} e^{X_i\beta_j}}$$

and for the baseline category, 

$$\pi_{ij^*} = \frac{1}{1 + \sum_{j \ne j^*} \exp(y_{ij})} = \frac{1}{1 + \sum_{j \ne j^*} e^{X_i\beta_j}}$$

**Assumptions**

Multinomial logistic regression applies when the dependent variable is categorical. It presumes a linear relationship between the log relative risk of the dependent variable and $X$ with residuals $\epsilon$ that are independent. It also assumes there is no severe multicollinearity in the predictors, and there is independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA). IIA means the relative likelihood of being in one category compared to the base category would not change if you added other categories. 

### Case Study {.unnumbered #cs2}

This case study uses the data set from [this UCLA tutorial](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/dae/multinomial-logistic-regression/). A study measures the association between students' academic program (academic, general, and vocational) and their socioeconomic status (SES) (low, middle, high) and writing score.

```{r eval=FALSE}
download.file(
  "https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/hsbdemo.dta",
  "./input/hsbdemo.dta",
  mode = "wb"
)
```

```{r}
cs2 <- list()

cs2$dat <- foreign::read.dta("./input/hsbdemo.dta") %>%
  # Just keep cols relevant to study
  select(id, prog, ses, write) %>%
  mutate(prog = fct_relevel(prog, "academic", after = 0))

cs2$dat %>%
  gtsummary::tbl_summary(
    by = prog,
    include = c(prog, ses, write),
    statistic = list(gtsummary::all_continuous() ~ "{mean}, {sd}")
  ) %>%
  gtsummary::add_overall()
```

<br>

Conduct a brief exploratory analysis to establish your expectations. Academic programs are associated with higher writing scores and SES. General and vocational programs are the opposite, although SES has opposing effects for general (increased probability) and vocational (decreased probability).

```{r}
cs2$dat %>%
  mutate(write_bin = cut(write, breaks = 5, dig.lab = 1, right = FALSE)) %>%
  count(prog, ses, write_bin) %>%
  mutate(.by = c(ses, write_bin), prob = n / sum(n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = write_bin, y = prob, color = ses)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = ses)) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(prog)) +
  theme(legend.position = "top") +
  labs(title = "Program Proportions by SES")
```

If your model is predictive rather than inferential, split the data into training/testing data sets.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
# For reproducibility
set.seed(123)

(x <- initial_split(cs2$dat, prop = 0.7, strata = prog))

cs2$dat_training <- training(x)
dim(cs2$dat_training)

cs2$dat_testing <- testing(x)
dim(cs2$dat_testing)
```
### Fit the Model {-}

The multinomial logitistic regression model engines all seem to be related to neural networks and advise that predictors be set on a common scale by normalizing. I have only one predictor other than SES in this model, but I'll normalize it anyway.  Normalizing `write` will also facilitate model interpretation. The intercept will represent a reasonable condition (average writing score) and a one-unit increase in `write` will represent a 1 SD increase in writing. 

:::rmdnote
This case study will use both the `parsnip` package to fit a model directly to a data set, and the `recipes` package to preprocess the data. `parsnip` is fine for most applications and it seems to be better supported by other functions, like `tidy()`, so stick with it for inferential applications. `recipes` has the advantage of being able to process data in a workflow, so you don't have to transform new data to make predictions. See more uses of `recipes` on the [tidy models documentation](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/recipes/).
:::

Let's first use `parsnip` to fit the full data set for an inferential application.

```{r}
# Create the model. This much is the same for parsnip or recipes.
cs2$model <-
  multinom_reg() %>%
  set_engine("nnet")

# For parsnip, you need to normalize the data explicitly. nnet requires dummy
# vars for factor predictors, but thankfully parsnip does that implicitly. 
# However, I want the outcome variable base level to be "academic" and while
# recipes can do that in pre-processing, I have to do it manually for parsnip.
cs2$dat_normalized <-
  cs2$dat %>%
  # Cast to numeric, otherwise scale() returns an nmatrix. :(
  mutate(write = as.numeric(scale(write, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)))

# Fit the whole data set for an explanatory model.
cs2$fit <-
  cs2$model %>%
  fit(prog ~ ses + write, data = cs2$dat_normalized)

# Extract the fit object returned by the engine. Use for interpretation and 
# checking assumptions.
cs2$result <-
  cs2$fit %>%
  extract_fit_engine()
```

In parallel, let's use `recipes` to fit a predictive model to the training data. The model object is already created, so we just need to pair a recipe object with a workflow.

```{r}
cs2$rec <-
  # The `data` argument can be the base data, or training, or even testing. 
  # recipe() only uses it to catalog variable names and data types.
  recipe(prog ~ ses + write, data = cs2$dat) %>%
  # You could have specified the formula as prog ~ ., then assigned roles. E.g.,
  # Keep "id" in data set, but don't use it in the model like this:
  # update_role(id, new_role = "ID") %>%
  # Unlike parsnip, recipe does not automatically create dummy vars.
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  # Not relevant here, but good practice: if a factor level has few values, it may
  # not appear in the training set. If so, its dummy will contain a single value
  # (0). You can prevent that by dropping zero-value cols.
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>%
  # Set the reference level of the outcome here if you want.
  step_relevel(prog, ref_level = "academic") %>%
  # Normalize write.
  step_normalize(write)

# The workflow pairs the model and recipe.
cs2$wflow <-
  workflow() %>%
  add_model(cs2$model) %>%
  add_recipe(cs2$rec)

# Fit the training data set for a predictive model.
cs2$fit_training <-
  cs2$wflow %>%
  fit(data = cs2$dat_training)

# You can't extract the engine fit and pipe into summary. Seems like a bug
# cs2$result_training <- cs2$fit_training %>% extract_fit_engine()
```

Let's look at the explanatory model summary object. The model produces a set of coefficient estimates for each non-reference level of the dependent variable. The `nnet` engine presents the coefficient estimates, then their standard errors as a second section, but does not present the *z*-statistic or *p*-values! 

```{r}
cs2$result %>% summary()
```

The residual deviance is $G^2 = 2 \sum_{i,j}y_{ij} \log \frac{y_{ij}}{\hat{\pi}_{ij}}$. Another model diagnostic is the log-likelihood, $-G^2 / 2$ (not shown) and AIC. More on these in the Model Fit section.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
deviance(cs2$result)
logLik(cs2$result, sum = TRUE)
```

The Wald *z*-statistic is $z = \hat{\beta} / SE(\hat{\beta})$. Its square is the Wald chi-squared statistic. The _p_-value is the area to the right of $z^2$ in the $\chi_1^2$ density curve. Get these from `tidy()`.

```{r}
cs2$result %>% tidy()
```

### Interpretation {-}

Start with interpreting the dependent variable. The model fits the **log relative risk** of belonging to program $j \in$ [vocation, general] vs. $j^*$ = academic. However, `predict()` returns either the risk (`type` = "probs") or outcome (`type` = "class), not the log relative risk. Plug in values for the predictor variables to get predictions. The relative risk is $RR = \exp (\hat{y}_j) = \pi_j / \pi_{j^*}$. We see here that a student of low SES and mean writing score is less likely to be in a general or vocation program than an academic program.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
(risk <- predict(cs2$result, newdata = list(ses = "low", write = 0), type = "probs"))

# Relative risk.
(rr <- risk[-1] / risk[1])

# Log-relative risk (the modeled outcome)
(log_rr <- log(rr))
```

Move on to the coefficients. Interpret $\hat{\beta}$ as the change in the _log relative risk_ of $y_j$ relative to $y_{j^*}$ due to a $\delta$ = one unit change in $x$. A $\delta = x_a - x_b$ change in $x$ is associated with a $\delta \hat{\beta}$ change. $\delta\beta$ is the log relative risk ratio.

$$\log \left(\pi_j / \pi_{j^*} |_{x = x_a} \right) - \log \left(\pi_j / \pi_{j^*} |_{x = x_b} \right) = \log \left( \frac{\pi_j / \pi_{j^*} |_{x = x_a}}{\pi_j / \pi_{j^*} |_{x = x_b}} \right) = \delta \hat{\beta}$$

The exponential of $\hat{\beta}$ is the change in the _relative risk_ of $y_j$ relative to $y_{j^*}$ due to a $\delta$ = one unit change in $x$. $\exp \delta \beta$ is the relative risk ratio.

$$\pi_j / \pi_{j^*} |_{x = x_a} = \exp{\delta \hat{\beta}}$$

The intercept term is the log-relative risk of $y_j$ relative to $y_{j^*}$ for the reference case. The reference case in the model is `ses` = "low" and `write` centered at `r comma(mean(cs2$dat$write), .1)`. Notice how the intercept matches the predicted values above.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
(ref_log_rr <- coef(cs2$result)[,"(Intercept)"])

# From log-relative risk to relative risk.
(ref_rr <- exp(ref_log_rr))
```

The log relative risks of a low SES student with a `r comma(mean(cs2$dat$write), .1)` writing score being in program general vs academic is $\hat{y} = \mathrm{Intercept}_1$ = `r comma(ref_log_rr[1], .001)`, and $\hat{y} = \mathrm{Intercept}_2$ = `r comma(ref_log_rr[2], .001)` for vocation vs academic. The corresponding relative risks are $\exp(\hat{y}_j)$ = `r comma(ref_rr[1], .001)` and `r comma(ref_rr[2], .001)`. The expected probabilities are `r percent(risk[1], .1)`, `r percent(risk[2], .1)`, and `r percent(risk[3], .1)` for academic, general, and vocation respectively.

```{r include=FALSE}
ses_high <- predict(cs2$result, newdata = list(ses = "high", write = 0), type = "probs")
```

If SES was high instead of low, the expected probabilities of being in program general vs academic would be `r percent(ses_high[1], .1)`, `r percent(ses_high[2], .1)`, and `r percent(ses_high[3], .1)` for academic, general, and vocation respectively. 

What if the writing score increases by 1 SD (one unit)? The log RR of being in program general vs academic change by a factor of `coef(cs2$result)["general", "write"]` = `r coef(cs2$result)["general", "write"] %>% comma(.001)`, RR = `r exp(coef(cs2$result)["general", "write"]) %>% comma(.001)`. For program vocation vs academic, it would change by a factor of `r coef(cs2$result)["vocation", "write"] %>% comma(.001)`, RR = `r exp(coef(cs2$result)["vocation", "write"]) %>% comma(.001)`. To get a 2 SD increase, multiply the coefficient by 2, then exponentiate. The two RRs would then be `r exp(coef(cs2$result)["general", "write"]*2) %>% comma(.001)` and `r exp(coef(cs2$result)["vocation", "write"]*2) %>% comma(.001)`.

Visualize the parameter estimates by plotting the predicted values.

```{r}
new_data <- expand.grid(
  ses = levels(cs2$dat$ses),
  write = seq(from = round(min(cs2$dat_normalized$write)), 
              to = round(max(cs2$dat_normalized$write)), 
              by = 1)
)

bind_cols(
  new_data,
  predict(cs2$fit, new_data = new_data, type = "prob")
) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -c(ses, write), names_to = "prog", values_to = "probability") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = write, y = probability, color = ses)) +
  geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(prog))
```

### Assumptions {-}

Four assumptions relate to the study design: (1) the dependent variable is multinomial; (2) the observations are independent; (3) the categories of all nominal variables are mutually exclusive and exhaustive; and (4) there are at least 10 observations per dependent variable level and independent variable. These assumptions are all valid. Three more assumptions related to the data distribution: 

- There is a linear relationship between the logit transformation and the continuous independent variables. Test with a plot and with Box-Tidwell.

- There is no independent variable multicollinearity. Test with correlation coefficients and variance inflation factors (VIF).

- There are no influential outliers. Test with Cook's distance. 

There are two ways to test for linearity (do both). First, plot the _fitted values_ against the continuous predictors. This is the GLM analog to OLS bivariate analysis, except now the dependent variable is the _logit_ transformation. These plotted relationships look good, except that in the `prog` = general level, writing score appears to interact with SES.

```{r}
cs2$fit %>%
  augment(new_data = cs2$dat_normalized) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(.pred_academic:.pred_vocation), values_to = ".fitted") %>%
  filter(str_detect(name, as.character(prog))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = write, y = .fitted, color = ses)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(prog), scales = "free_x") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y~x") +
  labs(title = "Linearity Test: predicted vs continuous predictors", x = NULL)
```

The second test for linearity is the Box-Tidwell approach. Add transformations of the continuous independent variables to the model, $x_{Tx} = x \log x$, then test their significance level in the fit. Focus on the transformed variable. `write_tx` has a *p*-value <.05 for general. It is customary to apply a Bonferroni adjustment when testing for linearity. There are ten predictors in the model (including the intercept terms), so the Bonferroni adjusted *p*-values for `write_tx` are multiplied by 10. We should reject the null hypothesis of linearity because the adjusted p.value is still below .05.

```{r}
# Using non-centered vars to avoid log(0) errors.
cs2$boxtidwell <- cs2$dat %>%
  mutate(write_tx = log(write) * write) %>%
  fit(cs2$model, prog ~ ses + write + write_tx, data = .)

tidy(cs2$boxtidwell) %>% filter(term == "write_tx") %>% mutate(adj_p = p.value * 10)
```

If the relationship is nonlinear, you can try transforming the variable by raising it to $\lambda = 1 + b / \gamma$ where $b$ is the estimated coefficient of the model without the interaction terms, and $\gamma$ is the estimated coefficient of the interaction term of the model with interactions. For `write`, $b$ is `r comma(coef(cs2$fit_nnet)[1, "write_c"], .001)` for general and $\gamma$ is `r comma(coef(cs2$boxtidwell)[1, "write_tx"], .001)`, so $\lambda$ = 1 + `r comma(coef(cs2$fit_nnet)[1, "write_c"], .001)` / `r comma(coef(cs2$boxtidwell)[1, "write_tx"], .001)` = `r comma(1 + coef(cs2$fit_nnet)[1, "write_c"] / coef(cs2$boxtidwell)[1, "write_tx"], .001)`. It seems customary to apply general transformations like .5 (square root), 1/3 (cube root), ln, and the reciprocal, so maybe try raising `write_c` to `r comma(1 + coef(cs2$fit_nnet)[1, "write_c"] / coef(cs2$boxtidwell)[1, "write_tx"], 1)`. It seems in this case that the better solution is to add an interaction between `write_c` and `ses` to the model. I'm not going to pursue this further here.

Check for multicollinearity using variance inflation factors (VIF). VIFs estimate how much the variance of a regression coefficient is inflated due to multicollinearity. When independent variables are correlated, it is difficult to say which variable really influences the dependent variable. The VIF for variable $i$ is

$$
\mathrm{VIF}_i = \frac{1}{1 - R_i^2}
$$

where $R_i^2$ is the coefficient of determination (i.e., the proportion of dependent variance explained by the model) of a regression of $X_i$ against all of the other predictors, $X_i = X_{j \ne i} \beta + \epsilon$. If $X_i$ is totally unrelated to its covariates, then $R_i^2$ will be zero and $\mathrm{VIF}_i$ will be 1. If $R_i^2$ is .8, $\mathrm{VIF}_i$ will be 5. The rule of thumb is that $R_i^2 \le 5$ is tolerable, and $R_i^2 > 5$ is "highly correlated" and you have to do something about it. `car::vif()` doesn't work for multinomial logistic regression. The model type is not actually important here - we're concerned about the covariate relationships. Below, I successively collapse the dependent variable into two-levels, then fit a binomial logistic regression and pipe that into `car::vif()`.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
tmp_fit_general <-
  logistic_reg() %>%
  fit(
    prog ~ ses + write, 
    data = cs2$dat_normalized %>% mutate(prog = fct_collapse(prog, vocation = "academic"))
  ) %>%
  extract_fit_engine() 

tmp_fit_general %>% car::vif()

tmp_fit_vocation <- 
  logistic_reg() %>%
  fit(
    prog ~ ses + write, 
    data = cs2$dat_normalized %>% mutate(prog = fct_collapse(prog, general = "academic"))
  ) %>%
  extract_fit_engine()

tmp_fit_vocation %>% car::vif()
```

Check for influential outliers. Outliers are predicted values greater than two standard deviations from the actual value. Influential points have a Cook's Distance greater than 4/N (4 / `r nrow(cs2$dat)` = `r 4 / nrow(cs2$dat)`.^[Cook's distance measures how much predicted values change when observation *i* is removed from the data. [This article](https://towardsdatascience.com/assumptions-of-logistic-regression-clearly-explained-44d85a22b290) suggests using three standard deviations for an outliers threshold.] Influential outliers are both. There is no simple way to do this for the multinomial regression because neither VGAM nor nnet support the `augment()` generic. Instead, I will use the two *binomial logistic* regressions from the VIF diagnostic. 

```{r}
outlier_dat <-
  bind_rows(
    general = augment(tmp_fit_general, type.predict = "response"),
    vocation = augment(tmp_fit_vocation, type.predict = "response"),
    .id = "logit"
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    id = row_number(),
    outlier = if_else(abs(.std.resid) >= 2, "Outlier", "Other"),
    influential = if_else(.cooksd > 4 / nrow(cs1$dat), "Influential", "Other"),
    status = case_when(
      outlier == "Outlier" & influential == "Influential" ~ "Influential Outlier",
      outlier == "Outlier" ~ "Outlier",
      influential == "Influential" ~ "Influential",
      TRUE ~ "Other"
    ),
    status = factor(status, levels = c("Influential", "Outlier", "Influential Outlier", "Other"))
  )

outlier_dat %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, y = .cooksd)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = status)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = if_else(influential == "Influential", id, NA_integer_)), 
            check_overlap = TRUE, size = 3, nudge_x = .025) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 4 / nrow(cs1$dat), linetype = 2, color = "goldenrod") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Influential Outlier" = "firebrick", 
                                "Influential" = "goldenrod",
                                "Outlier" = "salmon",
                                "Other" = "black")) +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +
  labs(title = "Index Plot of Cook's Distance.",
       subtitle = "Row id labeled for influential points.") +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(logit), ncol = 1)
```

No fitted values were influential outliers in the first fit, and only two were influential outliers in the second fit. 

```{r}
(cs2$outliers <-
  outlier_dat %>% filter(status == "Influential Outlier") %>% pull(.std.resid))
```

An index plot of Cook's Distance shows the two points at the far left. You might examine the observations for validity. Otherwise, proceed and explain that there were two standardized residuals with value of `r comma(cs2$outliers[1], .01)` and `r comma(cs2$outliers[2], .01)` standard deviations which were kept in the analysis. 

### Evaluate the Fit {-}

There are several ways to evaluate the model fit. 

- Deviance and chi-squared tests for lack of fit
- The likelihood ratio test
- Pseudo R-squared^[Nice write-up [here](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/faq/general/faq-what-are-pseudo-r-squareds/). Sounds like you should use pseudo R2 for model comparison, not for reporting goodness of fit].
- Accuracy measures
- Gain and ROC curves

The **deviance test** for lack of fit and the **likelihood ratio test** are residuals tests. The deviance residual is defined as $d_i = \mathrm{sign}(\epsilon_i) \left[ -2(y_i \log \hat{\pi}_i + (1 - y_i) \log (1 - \hat{\pi}_i)) \right]^{.5}$. The model deviance, $G^2$, is the sum of the squared deviance residuals. It also equals $G^2 = 2 \sum_{i,j}y_{ij} \log \frac{y_{ij}}{\hat{\pi}_{ij}}$. You can calculate them by hand.

```{r collapse=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Actual values (1s and 0s for three response levels)
y <- cs2$dat %>% 
  mutate(val = 1) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = prog, values_from = val, values_fill = 0) %>%
  select(levels(cs2$dat$prog)) %>%
  as.matrix()

# Predicted values (probabilities for three response levels)
pi <- predict(cs2$result, type = "prob") * 1

# Raw residuals, by hand or by formula
# e <- y - pi
e <- residuals(cs2$result, type = "response")

# Deviance residuals
d <- sign(e) * sqrt(-2 * y * log(pi) + (1 - y) * log(1 - pi))

(g2 <- sum(d^2, na.rm = TRUE))
(g2 <- 2 * sum(y * log(y / pi), na.rm = TRUE))
(g2 <- deviance(cs2$result))
```

The related Pearson statistic, $X$, is the sum of the squared *Pearson residuals*, $pr_i = \epsilon_i / \sqrt{\hat{\pi}_i}$, the raw residual scaled by dividing by the estimated standard deviation of a binomial distribution with 1 trial. I don't see this calculated in the `residual()` functions. You can do it yourself.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
(x2 <- sum((e / sqrt(pi))^2))
```

The deviance and Pearson statistic are distributed chi-squared with $(N - p)(r - 1)$ degrees of freedom where $p$ = 4 predictor variables (3 SES levels + intercept), and $r$ = 3 levels of the dependent variable for `r (nrow(cs2$dat) - 4) * (3 - 1)` degrees of freedom. The deviance and Pearson tests for lack of fit calculate the probability of the test statistic. The null hypothesis is that the model is correct. Neither test rejects the null hypothesis.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
# Deviance test for lack of fit
(N <- nrow(cs2$dat))
(r <- length(levels(cs2$dat$prog)))
(p <- length(coef(cs2$result)) / (r - 1)) # coefficients for each level, so divide by # levels
(df <- (N - p) * (r - 1))

pchisq(g2, df, lower.tail = FALSE)

pchisq(x2, df, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

You can do the same calculations for the intercept-only model.

```{r collapse=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
io <- multinom_reg() %>% fit(prog ~ 1, data = cs2$dat) %>% extract_fit_engine()

deviance(io)

# degrees of freedom
((nrow(cs2$dat) - length(coef(io)) / (r - 1)) * (r - 1))
```

The log-likelihood measures the unexplained variability in the model. The **likelihood ratio test** compares the log likelihood of the fitted model to the intercept-only model. You can use `lmtest::lrtest()` to test. `anova()` does the same thing using the residual deviance, $G2 = -2 \times \mathrm{log likelihood}$, although it does not seem to work with the `nnet` engine.

```{r}
(cs2$lrtest <- lmtest::lrtest(io, cs2$result))
# (cs2$lrtest <- anova(io, cs2$result, type = "I", test = "LR"))
```

The difference in deviances is $LR$ = `r comma(cs2$lrtest$Chisq[2], .01)` with `r cs2$lrtest$Df[2]` degrees of freedom. This is distributed chi-squared, with *p*-value = `r scientific(cs2$lrtest$"Pr(>Chisq)"[2], 4)`. The deviance test for lack of fit concludes that the model fits significantly better than an empty (intercept-only) model, $\chi^2$(`r cs2$lrtest$Df[2]`) = `r comma(cs2$lrtest$Chisq[2], .01)`, p < .001.

You can use `lmtest::lrtest()` to perform likelihood ratio tests on the significance of the predictors too. The likelihood ratio test compares the log likelihood with and without the predictor. Unfortunately, this does not seem to work within the `parsnip` framework.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
# (cs2$lrtest_ses <- lmtest::lrtest(cs2$result, "ses"))
no_ses <- multinom_reg() %>% fit(prog ~ write, data = cs2$dat) %>% extract_fit_engine()
(cs2$lrtest_ses <- lmtest::lrtest(cs2$result, no_ses))

# (cs2$lrtest_write <- lmtest::lrtest(cs2$fit_nnet, "write"))
no_write <- multinom_reg() %>% fit(prog ~ ses, data = cs2$dat) %>% extract_fit_engine()
(cs2$lrtest_write <- lmtest::lrtest(cs2$result, no_write))
```

Both SES, $X^2$ = `r comma(cs2$lrtest_ses$Chisq[2], .001)`, *p* = `r comma(cs2$lrtest_ses$"Pr(>Chisq)"[2], .001)`, and writing score $X^2$ = `r comma(cs2$lrtest_write$Chisq[2], .001)`, *p* = `r scientific(cs2$lrtest_write$"Pr(>Chisq)"[2], 4)`, had significant effects on the program.

Logistic regression does not have a direct R-squared statistic like OLS does (the proportion of variance explained by the model). However, there are some analogs, called pseudo R-squared. You'll encounter three pseudo R-squared measures: Cox and Snell, Nagelkerke, and McFadden. This one does not work for the `nnet` engine.

```{r}
# DescTools::PseudoR2(cs2$result, which = c("CoxSnell", "Nagelkerke", "McFadden"))
```

Accuracy measures formed by the cross-tabulation of observed and predicted classes is the better model fit diagnostic the the pseudo r-squares.

```{r}
cs2$conf_mat <-
  cs2$fit %>% 
  augment(new_data = cs2$dat_normalized) %>%
  # conf_mat requires truth to be first level of the factor variable.
  # mutate(across(c(prog, .pred_class), ~fct_relevel(., "academic"))) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = prog, estimate = .pred_class)

cs2$conf_mat

cs2$conf_mat %>% summary()

cs1$conf_mat %>% autoplot()
```

The model accuracy, `r cs2$conf_mat %>% summary() %>% filter(.metric == "accuracy") %>% pull(.estimate) %>% percent(.1)`, is the percent of observations correctly classified. The sensitivities are the accuracy with regard to predicting positive cases in each level of the dependent variable. The specificities are the accuracy with regard to predicting negative cases. The prevalences are the proportion of cases that were positive. 

Finally, plot the [gain curve or ROC curve](https://community.tibco.com/wiki/gains-vs-roc-curves-do-you-understand-difference). In the **gain curve**, the x-axis is the fraction of items seen when sorted by the predicted value, and the y-axis is the cumulatively summed true outcome. The "wizard" curve is the gain curve when the data is sorted by the true outcome.  If the model's gain curve is close to the wizard curve, then the model predicts the response well. The gray area is the "gain" over a random prediction.

```{r}
cs2$dat_normalized %>%
  bind_cols(predict(cs2$fit, new_data = cs2$dat_normalized, type = "prob")) %>%
  # event_level = "second" sets the second level as success
  yardstick::gain_curve(.pred_academic, .pred_general, .pred_vocation, 
                        truth = prog, event_level = "second") %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(title = "Gain Curve")
```

`r sum(cs2$dat$prog == "academic")` of the `r nrow(cs2$dat)` participants were in the academic program. 

- The gain curve encountered 52 academic programs (50%) within the first 72 observations (36%). It encountered all `r sum(cs2$dat$prog == "academic")` cases on the 189th observation.
- The bottom of the grey area is the outcome of a random model. Only half the academic program cases would be observed within 50% of the observations.  
- The top of the grey area is the outcome of the perfect model, the "wizard curve". Half the academic program cases would be observed in `r sum(cs2$dat$prog == "academic")/2`/`r nrow(cs2$dat)`=`r percent(sum(cs2$dat$prog == "academic")/2 / nrow(cs2$dat), .01)` of the observations.

The **ROC** (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve plots sensitivity vs specificity at varying cut-off values for the probability ranging from 0 to 1. Ideally, you want very little trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, with a curve hugging the left and top axes.

```{r}
cs2$dat_normalized %>%
  bind_cols(predict(cs2$fit, new_data = cs2$dat_normalized, type = "prob")) %>%
  # event_level = "second" sets the second level as success
  yardstick::roc_curve(.pred_academic, .pred_general, .pred_vocation, 
                        truth = prog, event_level = "second") %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(title = "Gain Curve")
```

### Reporting {-}

> A multinomial logistic regression was performed to ascertain the effects of socioeconomic status (ses) and writing score on the likelihood that participants are enrolled in an academic, general, or vocation program. Linearity of the continuous variables with respect to the logit of the dependent variable was assessed via the Box-Tidwell (1962) procedure. A Bonferroni correction was applied using all eight terms in the model resulting in statistical significance being accepted when *p* < `r comma(.05/8, .00001)` (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2014). Based on this assessment, the continuous `write` independent variable was found to be linearly related to the logit of the dependent variable levels. There were two standardized residuals with value of `r comma(cs2$outliers[1], .01)` and `r comma(cs2$outliers[2], .01)` standard deviations, which were kept in the analysis. The multinomial logistic regression model was statistically significant, $\chi^2$(`r cs2$lrtest$Df[2]`) = `r comma(cs2$lrtest$Chisq[2], .01)`, p < .001. The model correctly classified `r cs2$conf_mat %>% summary() %>% filter(.metric == "accuracy") %>% pull(.estimate) %>% percent(1)` of cases. Sensitivity was `r cs2$conf_mat %>% summary() %>% filter(.metric == "sens") %>% pull(.estimate) %>% percent(1)`, specificity was `r cs2$conf_mat %>% summary() %>% filter(.metric == "spec") %>% pull(.estimate) %>% percent(1)`, positive predictive value was `r cs2$conf_mat %>% summary() %>% filter(.metric == "ppv") %>% pull(.estimate) %>% percent(1)` and negative predictive value was `r cs2$conf_mat %>% summary() %>% filter(.metric == "npv") %>% pull(.estimate) %>% percent(1)`. The `write` predictor variable was statistically significant for both outcome levels and high SES was statistically significant for the general program (as shown in Table 1). A 1SD increase in the writing score was associated with a (1 - `r cs2$result %>% coef() %>% .["general", "write"] %>% exp() %>% comma(.01)`) decrease in the odds of choosing a general program instead of academic and a (1 - `r cs2$result %>% coef() %>% .["vocation", "write"] %>% exp() %>% comma(.01)`) decrease in the odds of choosing a vocation program over academic. A high SEC was associated with a (1 - `r cs2$result %>% coef() %>% .["general", "seshigh"] %>% exp() %>% comma(.01)`) decrease in the odds of chooseing a general program over academic.

## Ordinal Logistic Regression {#ordinallogistic}

Ordinal logistic regression, also call cumulative link model (CLM), is a generalized linear model (GZLM), an extension of the general linear model (GLM) to non-continuous outcome variables. There are many approaches to ordinal logistic regression, including cumulative, adjacent, and continuation categories, but the most popular is the **cumulative odds ordinal logistic regression with proportional odds**.^[These notes rely on [UVA](https://data.library.virginia.edu/fitting-and-interpreting-a-proportional-odds-model/), [PSU](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat504/),  [Laerd](https://statistics.laerd.com/spss-tutorials/ordinal-regression-using-spss-statistics.php), and the CLM package [article vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ordinal/vignettes/clm_article.pdf)]. The model for ordinal response random variable $Y_i$ with $J$ levels is

$$\gamma_{ij} = F(\eta_{ij}), \hspace{5 mm} \eta_{ij} = \theta_j - x_i^\mathrm{T}\beta, \hspace{5 mm} i = 1, \ldots, n, \hspace{5 mm} j = 1, \ldots, J-1$$

where $\gamma_{ij} = P(Y_i \le j) = \pi_{i1} + \cdots + \pi_{ij}$. $\eta_{ij}$ is a linear predictor with $J-1$ intercepts. $F$ is the inverse link function. The regression models the logit link function of $\gamma_{ij}$.

$$\mathrm{logit}(\gamma_{ij}) = \log \left[\frac{P(Y_i \le j)}{P(Y_i \gt j)} \right] = \theta_j - x_i^\mathrm{T}\beta$$
The cumulative logit is the log-odds of the cumulative probabilities that the response is in category $\le j$ versus $\gt j$. $\theta_j$ is the log-odds when $x_i^\mathrm{T}=0$ and $\beta$ is the increase in the log odds attributed to a one unit increase in $x_i^\mathrm{T}$. Notice $\beta$ is the same for all $j$. The exponential of the predicted value is the odds. Solve this for the probability, 

$$P(Y_i \gt j) = \frac{\mathrm{exp}(\hat{y}_i)}{1 + \mathrm{exp}(\hat{y}_i)}.$$

The exponential of $\beta$ is the odds ratio of $x_1^\mathrm{T} - x_0^\mathrm{T}$. Solve this for the odds ratio 

$$\mathrm{OR} = \frac{\mathrm{exp}(\theta_j - x_1^\mathrm{T}\beta)}{\mathrm{exp}(\theta_j - x_2^\mathrm{T}\beta)} = \mathrm{exp}(\beta(x_1^\mathrm{T} - x_0^\mathrm{T}))$$

If $x$ is a binary factor factor, then $\exp(\beta)$ is the odds ratio of $x=1$ vs $x=0$. Thus the odds-ratio is *proportional* to the difference between values of $x$ and $\beta$ is the constant of proportionality.

The model is estimated with a regularized Newton-Raphson algorithm with step-halving (line search) using analytic expressions for the gradient and Hessian of the negative log-likelihood function. This is beyond me, but the upshot is that the estimation is an iterative maximization exercise, not a formulaic matrix algebra process. It is possible for the model estimation to fail to converge on a maximum.

You will sometimes encounter discussion about the *latent variable*. That is just the underlying quality you are trying to measure. If you rate something a 4 on a 5-level Likert scale, 4 is the expression of your valuation, the latent variable. Your precise valuation is somewhere between 3 and 5 on a continuous scale. The link function defines the distribution of the latent variable.

There are variations on the ordinal model. Structured thresholds impose restrictions on $\theta_j$, for example requiring equal distances between levels. Partial proportional odds allow $\theta_j$ to vary with nominal predictors. You can also use link functions other than logit.

There are two assumptions underling ordinal logistic regression: (a) no multicollinearity, and (b) proportional odds.

### Case Study {.unnumbered #cs3}

This case study uses the [Laerd Statistics](https://statistics.laerd.com/) article on ordinal logistic regression [data set](https://statistics.laerd.com/premium/spss/spss-files/ordinal-logistic-regression.sav). A study investigates the relationship between attitude toward tax levels and participant values and background. 192 participants in a study responded to the statement "Taxes are too high" on a 4-level Likert scale (`tax_too_high`, *Strongly Disagree*, *Disagree*, *Agree*, *Strongly Agree*). Participant attributes include business owner (*Y*|*N*), age, and political affiliation (*Liberal*, *Conservative*, *Labor*). 

```{r}
cs3 <- list()

cs3$dat <- foreign::read.spss("./input/ordinal-logistic-regression.sav", to.data.frame = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(tax_too_high = factor(tax_too_high, ordered = TRUE),
         biz_owner = fct_relevel(biz_owner, "No", "Yes"),
         politics = fct_relevel(politics, "Lab")) %>%
  select(-c(biz_friends, uni_educated, income))

cs3$dat %>% 
  gtsummary::tbl_summary(
  by = politics, 
  statistic = list(gtsummary::all_continuous() ~ "{mean} ({sd})")
)
```

<br>

```{r}
cs3$dat %>%
  mutate(age = case_when(age < quantile(age, .33) ~ "young",
                         age < quantile(age, .67) ~ "middle",
                         TRUE ~ "old"),
         age = factor(age, levels = c("young", "middle", "old"))) %>%
  count(tax_too_high, biz_owner, age, politics) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = tax_too_high, y = n, fill = biz_owner)) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge2(preserve = "single")) +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(age), cols = vars(politics), space = "free") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = function (x) str_wrap(x, width = 10)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  labs(title = "Taxes too high?",
       subtitle = "Reponse count by business owner, age, and politics.")
```

### Fit the Model {-}

Fit a cumulative link model for the cumulative probability of the $i$th response falling in $j$th category or below where $i$ indexes the ($n = 192$) responses, $j = 1, \ldots, J$ indexes the ($J = 4$) response categories, and $\theta_j$ is the threshold for the $j$th cumulative logit.

$$\mathrm{logit}(P(Y_i \le j)) = \theta_j - \beta_1(\mathrm{politics}_i) - \beta_2(\mathrm{biz\_owner}_i) - \beta_3(\mathrm{age}_i)$$

```{r}
cs3$fmla <- formula(tax_too_high ~ biz_owner + age + politics)

cs3$result <- ordinal::clm(cs3$fmla, data = cs3$dat)

cs3$result %>% summary()
```

The summary object shows several fit statistics. More about these in the fit evaluation section below. The Coefficients table is the familiar parameter estimates. The coefficient estimate for `biz_ownerYes` is `r coef(summary(cs3$result))["biz_ownerYes", "Estimate"] %>% comma(.001)` with standard error `r coef(summary(cs3$result))["biz_ownerYes", "Std. Error"] %>% comma(.001)`, $z = \hat{\beta} / se =$ `r coef(summary(cs3$result))["biz_ownerYes", "z value"] %>% comma(.001)`, and $p = 2 \cdot P(Z>z) =$ `r coef(summary(cs3$result))["biz_ownerYes", "Pr(>|z|)"] %>% comma(.001)`. Some programs (e.g., SPSS) also show the Wald chi-squared statistic, $z^2 =$ `r coef(summary(cs3$result))["biz_ownerYes", "z value"]^2 %>% comma(.001)`. The square of a normal variable has a $\chi^2$ distribution, so the *p* value for the Wald chi-squared statistic is `pchisq(z^2, df = 1)` = `r coef(summary(cs3$result))["biz_ownerYes", "z value"]^2 %>% pchisq(df = 1, lower.tail = FALSE) %>% comma(.001)`.

The Threshold coefficients table are the intercepts, or cut-points. The first cut-point is the log-odds of response level *Strongly Disagree* (or less) vs greater than *Strongly Disagree* when all factor variables are at their reference level and the continuous vars are at 0.

There may be interaction effects between `biz_owner` and `politics`. You can check this by comparing the log likelihood to the saturated model with a likelihood ratio test.

```{r}
saturated <- ordinal::clm(tax_too_high ~ biz_owner*politics + age, data = cs3$dat)

(cs3$sat_anova <- anova(cs3$result, saturated))
```

The likelihood ratio test indicates the main-effects model fits about the same as the saturated model, $\chi^2$(`r cs3$sat_anova["saturated", "df"]`) = `r cs3$sat_anova["saturated", "LR.stat"] %>% comma(.01)`, *p* = `r cs3$sat_anova["saturated", "Pr(>Chisq)"] %>% comma(.001)`)

### Assumptions {-}

Cumulative odds ordinal logistic regression with proportional odds models require a) no multicollinearity, and b) proportional odds.

**Multicollinearity** occurs when two or more independent variables are *highly correlated* so that they do not provide unique or independent information in the regression model. Multicollinearity inflates the variances of the estimated coefficients, resulting in larger confidence intervals. The usual interpretation of a slope coefficient as the change in the mean response per unit increase in the predictor when all the other predictors are held constant breaks down because changing one predictor *necessarily* changes other predictors.

Test for multicollinearity with variance inflation factors (VIF). The VIF is the inflation percentage of the parameter variance due to multicollinearity. E.g., a VIF of 1.9 means the parameter variance is 90% larger than what it would be if it was not correlated with other predictors.

Predictor k's variance, $Var(\hat{\beta_k})$, is inflated by a factor of

$$\mathrm{VIF}_k = \frac{1}{1 - R_k^2}$$

due to collinearity with other predictors, where $R_k^2$ is the $R^2$ of a regression of the $k^{th}$ predictor on the remaining predictors. If predictor $k$ is unrelated to the other variables, $R_k^2 = 0$ and $VIF = 1$ (no variance inflation). If 100% of the variance in predictor $k$ is explained by the other predictors, then $R_k^2 = 1$ and $VIF = \infty$. The rule of thumb is that $VIF \le 5$ is acceptable.

```{r}
# Cannot use CLM model with vif(). Re-express as a linear model.
lm(as.numeric(tax_too_high) ~ politics + biz_owner + age, dat = cs3$dat) %>%
  car::vif()
```

The VIFs in column GVIF are all below 5, so this model is not compromised by multicollinearity.

The **proportional odds** assumption means the independent variable effects are constant across each cumulative split of the ordinal dependent variable. Test for proportional odds using a full [likelihood ratio test](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/faq/general/faqhow-are-the-likelihood-ratio-wald-and-lagrange-multiplier-score-tests-different-andor-similar/) comparing the proportional odds model with a multinomial logit model, also called an unconstrained baseline logit model. This is also called the *test of parallel lines*. The multinomial logit model fits a slope to each of the $J – 1$ levels. The proportional odds model is nested within the multinomial model, so you can use a likelihood ratio test to see if the models are statistically different. Fit the proportional odds model and a multinomial model using `VGAM::vglm()` and capture the log likelihoods and degrees of freedom. Perform a likelihood ratio test on the differences in log likelihoods, $D = -2 \mathrm{loglik}(\beta)$.

```{r}
cs3$vglm_ordinal     <- VGAM::vglm(cs3$fmla, VGAM::propodds,   data = cs3$dat)

cs3$vglm_multinomial <- VGAM::vglm(cs3$fmla, VGAM::cumulative, data = cs3$dat)

(cs3$po_lrt <- VGAM::lrtest(cs3$vglm_multinomial, cs3$vglm_ordinal))
```

> The assumption of proportional odds was met, as assessed by a full likelihood ratio test comparing the fit of the proportional odds model to a model with varying location parameters, $\chi^2$(8) = `r cs3$po_lrt %>% slot("Body") %>% tail(1) %>% pull(Chisq) %>% scales::number(accuracy = .001)`, *p* = `r cs3$po_lrt %>% slot("Body") %>% tail(1) %>% pull("Pr(>Chisq)") %>% scales::number(accuracy = .001)`.

Another option is the partial proportional odds test. This test locates specific variables causing the rejection of proportional odds.

```{r}
(cs3$po_lrt2 <- ordinal::clm(cs3$fmla, data = cs3$dat) %>% ordinal::nominal_test())
```

> The assumption of proportional odds was met, as assessed by a full likelihood ratio test comparing the fit of the proportional odds model to a model with varying location parameters for business owner, $\chi^2$(`r cs3$po_lrt2["biz_owner", "Df"]`) = `r cs3$po_lrt2["biz_owner", "LRT"] %>% comma(.001)`, *p* = `r cs3$po_lrt2["biz_owner", "Pr(>Chi)"] %>% comma(.001)` and politics, $\chi^2$(`r cs3$po_lrt2["politics", "Df"]`) = `r cs3$po_lrt2["politics", "LRT"] %>% comma(.001)`, *p* = `r cs3$po_lrt2["politics", "Pr(>Chi)"] %>% comma(.001)`.

### Evaluate the Fit {-}

There are three ways to assess overall model fit: The Deviance and Pearson goodness-of-fit tests of the overall model fit; the Cox and Snell, Nagelkerke, and McFadden pseudo R measures of explained variance; and the likelihood ratio test comparing the model fit to the intercept-only model. However, these tests rely on large frequencies in each *cell*, that is, each possible combination of predictor values. Overall goodness-of-fit statistics should be treated with suspicion when a continuous independent variable is present and/or there are a large number of cells with zero frequency.

The **Pearson goodness-of-fit** statistic is $X^2 = \sum \frac{(O_{ij} - E_{ij})^2}{E_{ij}}$ where $i$ is the observation number and $j$ is the response variable level. It is a summary of the Pearson residuals, the difference between the observed and expected cell counts, $O_{ij} - E_{ij}$. The **deviance goodness-of-fit** statistic is the difference in fit between the model and a full model; a full model being a model that fits the data perfectly, $G^2 = 2 \sum_{ij} O_{ij} \log \left( \frac{O_{ij}}{E_{ij}} \right)$. Neither of these tests are reliable if there are many cells with zero frequencies and/or small expected frequencies and are generally not recommended. Generally, the chi-squared test requires a frequency count of at least 5 per cell. 

```{r}
# Observed combinations of model vars
cs3$cell_patterns <- 
  cs3$dat %>% count(biz_owner, age, politics, tax_too_high) %>% nrow()

# Observed combinations of predictor vars * levels of response var
cs3$covariate_patterns <- 
  cs3$dat %>% count(biz_owner, age, politics) %>% nrow()
cs3$possible_cells <- 
  cs3$covariate_patterns * length(levels(cs3$dat$tax_too_high))

# 1 - ratio of observed to possible
cs3$pct_freq_zero <- 1 - cs3$cell_patterns / cs3$possible_cells
```

There are `r cs3$cell_patterns` observed combinations of model variables (predictors), and `r cs3$possible_cells` possible combinations (predictors * outcome levels), so `r cs3$pct_freq_zero %>% scales::percent(accuracy = .1)` of cells have zero frequencies. Ideally, zero frequencies should be less than 20%, so if you were to use the deviance or Pearson tests, you would need to report this. The results below are contradictory and bogus. I think you'd only use this test if you didn't have continuous predictor variables.

```{r}
observed <- cs3$dat %>% 
  count(biz_owner, age, politics, tax_too_high) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = tax_too_high, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = `Strongly Disagree`:`Strongly Agree`, 
    names_to = "outcome", 
    values_to = "observed"
  )

expected <- bind_cols(
  cs3$dat, 
  cs3$result %>% predict(newdata = cs3$dat %>% select(-"tax_too_high")) %>% data.frame()
) %>%
  rename_with(~str_remove(., "fit\\."), starts_with("fit")) %>%
  rename_with(~str_replace(., "\\.", " ")) %>%
  summarize(.by = c(biz_owner, age, politics), 
            across(`Strongly Disagree`:`Strongly Agree`, sum)) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = `Strongly Disagree`:`Strongly Agree`, names_to = "outcome", values_to = "expected")

obs_exp <- observed %>%
  inner_join(expected, by = c("politics", "biz_owner", "age", "outcome")) %>%
  mutate(epsilon_sq = (observed - expected)^2,
         chi_sq = epsilon_sq / expected,
         g_sq = 2 * observed * log((observed+.0001) / expected)
  )

cs3$chisq <- list()
cs3$chisq$X2 = sum(obs_exp$chi_sq)
cs3$chisq$G2 = sum(obs_exp$g_sq)
cs3$chisq$df = cs3$covariate_patterns * (length(levels(cs3$dat$tax_too_high)) - 1) - 7
cs3$chisq$X2_p.value = pchisq(cs3$chisq$X2, df = cs3$chisq$df, lower.tail = FALSE)
cs3$chisq$G2_p.value = pchisq(cs3$chisq$G2, df = cs3$chisq$df, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

> The Pearson goodness-of-fit test indicated that the model was *not* a good fit to the observed data, $\chi^2$(`r cs3$chisq$df`) = `r cs3$chisq$X2 %>% scales::comma(accuracy = 0.1)`, *p* < .001$. The deviance goodness-of-fit test indicated that the model was a good fit to the observed data, $G^2$(`r cs3$chisq$df`) = `r cs3$chisq$G2 %>% scales::comma(accuracy = 0.1)`, *p* = `r cs3$chisq$G2_p.value %>% scales::comma(accuracy = 0.001)`. 

There are a number of measures in ordinal regression that attempt to provide a similar "variance explained" measure as that provided in ordinary least-squares linear regression. However, these measures do not have the direct interpretation that they do in ordinary linear regression and are often, therefore, referred to as **"pseudo" R2 measures**. The three most common measures (Cox and Snell, Nagelkerke, and McFadden) are not particularly good and not universally used. It is presented in the SPSS output, so you might encounter it in published work.

```{r}
cs3$nagelkerke <- rcompanion::nagelkerke(cs3$result)
cs3$nagelkerke$Pseudo.R.squared.for.model.vs.null
```

The best way to assess model fit is the **likelihood ratio test** comparing the model to an intercept-only model. The difference in the -2 log likelihood between the models has a $\chi^2$ distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters.

```{r}
intercept_only <- ordinal::clm(tax_too_high ~ 1, data = cs3$dat)
cs3$lrt <- anova(cs3$result, intercept_only)
cs3$lrt
```

The table shows the log likelihoods of the two models. LR.stat is the difference between 2 * the logLik values.

> The final model statistically significantly predicted the dependent variable over and above the intercept-only model, $\chi^2(4)$ = `r cs3$lrt$LR.stat[2] %>% comma(.1)`, *p* = `r cs3$lrt[[6]][2] %>% comma(.001)`.

### Interpret Results {-}

Return to the model summary. 

```{r}
tidy(cs3$clm)
```

The coefficients for `biz_owner`, `age`, and politics are positive. Positive parameters *increase* the likelihood of stronger agreement with the statement. In this case, discontent with taxes are higher for business owners, increase with age, and are higher for Liberal Democrats and Conservatives relative to the Labor Party. The expected cumulative log-odds of declaring $\le j$ level of agreement with the statement for the baseline group (`biz_ownerNo`, `age = 0`, `politicsLib`) is `r cs3$clm$coefficients["Strongly Disagree|Disagree"] %>% scales::comma(accuracy = .001)` for $j = 1$ (Strongly Disagree), `r cs3$clm$coefficients["Disagree|Agree"] %>% scales::comma(accuracy = .001)` for $j = 2$ (Disagree), and `r cs3$clm$coefficients["Agree|Strongly Agree"] %>% scales::comma(accuracy = .001)` for $j = 3$ (Agree). 

You could solve the logit equation for 

$$\pi_j = \frac{\mathrm{exp}(Y_i)} {1 + \mathrm{exp}(Y_i)}$$
to get the cumulative probabilities for each level. That's what `predict(type = "cum.prob")` does. But it might be more intuitive to work with individual probabilities, the lagged differences to get the individual probabilities for each $j$. That's what `predict(type = "prob")` does. I like to play with predicted values to get a sense of the outcome distributions. In this case, I'll take the median `age`, and each combination of `biz_owner` and `politics`.

```{r fig.height=2.5, fig.width=6.5}
new_data <- cs3$dat %>% 
  mutate(age = median(cs3$dat$age)) %>% 
  expand(age, politics, biz_owner)

preds <- predict(cs3$result, newdata = new_data, type = "prob")[["fit"]] %>% as.data.frame()

bind_cols(new_data, preds) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = `Strongly Disagree`:`Strongly Agree`) %>% 
  mutate(name = factor(name, levels = levels(cs3$dat$tax_too_high))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = politics, x = value, fill = fct_rev(name))) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = scales::percent(value, accuracy = 1)), 
            size = 3, position = position_stack(vjust=0.5)) +
  facet_grid(~paste("Bus Owner = ", biz_owner)) +
  scale_fill_grey(start = 0.5, end = 0.8) +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(legend.position = "top",
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank()) +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) +
  labs(title = "Taxes too High for Conservative Business Owners?", 
       x = NULL, fill = NULL)
```

You will want to establish whether `politics` is statistically significant overall before exploring any specific contrasts. The ANOVA procedure with type I test reports an overall test of significance for each variable entered into the model.

```{r}
(cs3$anovaI <- anova(cs3$result, type = "I"))
```

> The political party last voted for has a statistically significant effect on the prediction of whether tax is thought to be too high, Wald $\chi^2$(`r cs3$anovaI$Df[3]`) = `r cs3$anovaI$Chisq[3] %>% scales::comma(accuracy = .1)`, *p* = `r cs3$anovaI[[3]][3] %>% scales::comma(accuracy = .001)`.

The best way to work with the data is with the `tidy(exponentiate = TRUE)` version. 

```{r}
cs3$tidy <- cs3$result %>% tidy(conf.int = TRUE, exponentiate = TRUE)
cs3$tidy
```

Then you can summarize the table in words.

An increase in age (expressed in years) was associated with an increase in the odds of considering tax too high, with an odds ratio of `r cs3$tidy %>% filter(term == "age") %>% pull(estimate) %>% scales::comma(accuracy = .001)` (95% CI, `r cs3$tidy %>% filter(term == "age") %>% pull(conf.low) %>% scales::comma(accuracy = .001)` to `r cs3$tidy %>% filter(term == "age") %>% pull(conf.high) %>% scales::comma(accuracy = .001)`), *z* = `r cs3$tidy %>% filter(term == "age") %>% pull(statistic) %>% scales::comma(accuracy = .001)`, *p* = `r cs3$tidy %>% filter(term == "age") %>% pull(p.value) %>% scales::comma(accuracy = .001)`.

Package **gtsummary** shows a nice summary table.

```{r}
gtsummary::tbl_regression(cs3$result)
```

## Poisson Regression {#poissonregression}

Poisson models count data, like "traffic tickets per day", or "website hits per day".  The response is an expected *rate* or intensity.  For count data, specify the generalized model, this time with `family = poisson` or `family = quasipoisson`. 

Recall that the probability of achieving a count $y$ when the expected rate is $\lambda$ is distributed 

$$P(Y = y|\lambda) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^y}{y!}.$$


The poisson regression model is

$$\lambda = \exp(X \beta).$$ 
 
You can solve this for $y$ to get

$$y = X\beta = \ln(\lambda).$$

That is, the model predicts the log of the response rate.  For a sample of size *n*, the likelihood function is

$$L(\beta; y, X) = \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{e^{-\exp({X_i\beta})}\exp({X_i\beta})^{y_i}}{y_i!}.$$

The log-likelihood is

$$l(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i X_i \beta - \sum_{i=1}^n\exp(X_i\beta) - \sum_{i=1}^n\log(y_i!).$$

Maximizing the log-likelihood has no closed-form solution, so the coefficient estimates are found through interatively reweighted least squares.  

Poisson processes assume the variance of the response variable equals its mean.  "Equals" means the mean and variance are of a similar order of magnitude.  If that assumption does not hold, use the quasi-poisson.  Use Poisson regression for large datasets.  If the predicted counts are much greater than zero (>30), the linear regression will work fine.  Whereas RMSE is not useful for logistic models, it is a good metric in Poisson.

### Case Study 4 {.unnumbered #cs4}

Dataset `fire` contains response variable `injuries` counting the number of injuries during the month and one explanatory variable, the month `mo`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
fire <- read_csv(file = "C:/Users/mpfol/OneDrive/Documents/Data Science/Data/CivilInjury_0.csv")
fire <- fire %>% 
  mutate(mo = as.POSIXlt(`Injury Date`)$mon + 1) %>%
  rename(dt = `Injury Date`,
         injuries = `Total Injuries`)
str(fire)
```

In a situation like this where there the relationship is bivariate, start with a visualization.

```{r eval=FALSE}
ggplot(fire, aes(x = mo, y = injuries)) +
  geom_jitter() +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family = "poisson")) +
  labs(title = "Injuries by Month")
```


Fit a poisson regression in R using `glm(formula, data, family = poisson)`.  But first, check whether the mean and variance of `injuries` are the same magnitude?  If not, then use `family = quasipoisson`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
mean(fire$injuries)
var(fire$injuries)
```

They are of the same magnitude, so fit the regression with `family = poisson`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
m2 <- glm(injuries ~ mo, family = poisson, data = fire)
summary(m2)
```

The *predicted* value $\hat{y}$ is the estimated **log** of the response variable, 

$$\hat{y} = X \hat{\beta} = \ln (\lambda).$$

Suppose `mo` is January (mo = `), then the log of `injuries` is $\hat{y} = 0.323787$. Or, more intuitively, the expected count of injuries is $\exp(0.323787) = 1.38$  

```{r eval=FALSE}
predict(m2, newdata = data.frame(mo=1))
predict(m2, newdata = data.frame(mo=1), type = "response")
```

Here is a plot of the predicted counts in red.

```{r eval=FALSE}
augment(m2, type.predict = "response") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mo, y = injuries)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_point(aes(y = .fitted), color = "red") + 
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, NA)) +
  labs(x = "Month",
       y = "Injuries",
       title = "Poisson Fitted Line Plot")
```

Evaluate a logistic model fit with an analysis of deviance.  

```{r eval=FALSE}
(perf <- glance(m2))
(pseudoR2 <- 1 - perf$deviance / perf$null.deviance)
```

The deviance of the null model (no regressors) is 139.9.  The deviance of the full model is 132.2.  The psuedo-R2 is very low at .05.  How about the RMSE?

```{r eval=FALSE}
RMSE(pred = predict(m2, type = "response"), obs = fire$injuries)
```

The average prediction error is about 0.99.  That's almost as much as the variance of `injuries` - i.e., just predicting the mean of `injuries` would be almost as good!  Use the `GainCurvePlot()` function to plot the gain curve.

```{r eval=FALSE}
augment(m2, type.predict = "response") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = injuries, y = .fitted)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method ="lm") +
  labs(x = "Actual",
       y = "Predicted",
       title = "Poisson Fitted vs Actual")
```


```{r eval=FALSE}
augment(m2) %>% data.frame() %>% 
  GainCurvePlot(xvar = ".fitted", truthVar = "injuries", title = "Poisson Model")
```

It seems that `mo` was a poor predictor of `injuries`.  

```{r eval=FALSE}

library(WVPlots)  # for GainCurvePlot()
library(caret)  # for RMSE()
library(foreign)

# Regularization

These notes are from this [tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-ridge-lasso-elastic-net) on DataCamp, the [Machine Learning Toolbox](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-toolbox) DataCamp class, and Interpretable Machine Learning [@Molner2020].

Regularization is a set of methods that manage the bias-variance trade-off problem in linear regression. 

The linear regression model is $Y = X \beta + \epsilon$, where $\epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$. OLS estimates the coefficients by minimizing the loss function

$$L = \sum_{i = 1}^n \left(y_i - x_i^{'} \hat\beta \right)^2.$$

The resulting estimate for the coefficients is 

$$\hat{\beta} = \left(X'X\right)^{-1}\left(X'Y\right).$$

There are two important characteristics of any estimator: its *bias* and its *variance*.  For OLS, these are

$$Bias(\hat{\beta}) = E(\hat{\beta}) - \beta = 0$$
and

$$Var(\hat{\beta}) = \sigma^2(X'X)^{-1}$$

where the unknown population variance $\sigma^2$ is estimated from the residuals

$$\hat\sigma^2 = \frac{\epsilon' \epsilon}{n - k}.$$

The OLS estimator is unbiased, but can have a large variance when the predictor variables are highly correlated with each other, or when there are many predictors (notice how $\hat{\sigma}^2$ increases as $k \rightarrow n$).  Stepwise selection balances the trade-off by eliminating variables, but this throws away information.  *Regularization* keeps all the predictors, but reduces coefficient magnitudes to reduce variance at the expense of some bias.

In the sections below, I'll use the `mtcars` data set to predict `mpg` from the other variables using the `caret::glmnet()` function.  `glmnet()` uses penalized maximum likelihood to fit generalized linear models such as ridge, lasso, and elastic net.  I'll compare the model performances by creating a training and validation set, and a common `trainControl` object to make sure the models use the same observations in the cross-validation folds.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)

data("mtcars")

set.seed(123)
partition <- createDataPartition(mtcars$mpg, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
training <- mtcars[partition, ]
testing <- mtcars[-partition, ]

train_control <- trainControl(
  method = "repeatedcv",
  number = 5,  
  repeats = 5,
  savePredictions = "final"  # saves predictions from optimal tuning parameters
)
```


## Ridge

Ridge regression estimates the linear model coefficients by minimizing an augmented loss function which includes a term, $\lambda$, that penalizes the magnitude of the coefficient estimates,

$$L = \sum_{i = 1}^n \left(y_i - x_i^{'} \hat\beta \right)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^k \hat{\beta}_j^2.$$

The resulting estimate for the coefficients is 

$$\hat{\beta} = \left(X'X + \lambda I\right)^{-1}\left(X'Y \right).$$

As $\lambda \rightarrow 0$, ridge regression approaches OLS.  The bias and variance for the ridge estimator are

$$Bias(\hat{\beta}) = -\lambda \left(X'X + \lambda I \right)^{-1} \beta$$
$$Var(\hat{\beta}) = \sigma^2 \left(X'X + \lambda I \right)^{-1}X'X \left(X'X + \lambda I \right)^{-1}$$

The estimator bias increases with $\lambda$ and the estimator variance decreases with $\lambda$.  The optimal level for $\lambda$ is the one that minimizes the root mean squared error (RMSE) or the Akaike or Bayesian Information Criterion (AIC or BIC), or R-squared.


#### Example {-}

Specify `alpha = 0` in a tuning grid for ridge regression (the following sections reveal how alpha distinguishes ridge, lasso, and elastic net). Note that I standardize the predictors in the `preProcess` step - ridge regression requires standardization.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
mdl_ridge <- train(
  mpg ~ .,
  data = training,
  method = "glmnet",
  metric = "RMSE",  # Choose from RMSE, RSquared, AIC, BIC, ...others?
  preProcess = c("center", "scale"),
  tuneGrid = expand.grid(
    .alpha = 0,  # optimize a ridge regression
    .lambda = seq(0, 5, length.out = 101)
  ),
  trControl = train_control
  )
mdl_ridge
```

The model printout shows the RMSE, R-Squared, and mean absolute error (MAE) values at each lambda specified in the tuning grid.  The final three lines summarize what happened. It did not tune alpha because I held it at 0 for ridge regression; it optimized using RMSE; and the optimal tuning values (at the minimum RMSE) were alpha = 0 and lambda = 2.75.  You plot the model to see the tuning results.

```{r}
ggplot(mdl_ridge) +
  labs(title = "Ridge Regression Parameter Tuning", x = "lambda")
```

`varImp()` ranks the predictors by the absolute value of the coefficients in the tuned model. The most important variables here were `wt`, `disp`, and `am`.

```{r}
plot(varImp(mdl_ridge))
```

## Lasso

Lasso stands for “least absolute shrinkage and selection operator”.  Like ridge, lasso adds a penalty for coefficients, but instead of penalizing the sum of squared coefficients (L2 penalty), lasso penalizes the sum of absolute values (L1 penalty). As a result, for high values of $\lambda$, coefficients can be zeroed under lasso.

The loss function for lasso is

$$L = \sum_{i = 1}^n \left(y_i - x_i^{'} \hat\beta \right)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^k \left| \hat{\beta}_j \right|.$$

#### Example {-}

Continuing with prediction of `mpg` from the other variables in the `mtcars` data set, follow the same steps as before, but with ridge regression.  This time specify parameter `alpha = 1` for ridge regression (it was 0 for ridge, and for elastic net it will be something in between and require optimization).

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
mdl_lasso <- train(
  mpg ~ .,
  data = training,
  method = "glmnet",
  metric = "RMSE",
  preProcess = c("center", "scale"),
  tuneGrid = expand.grid(
    .alpha = 1,  # optimize a lasso regression
    .lambda = seq(0, 5, length.out = 101)
  ),
  trControl = train_control
  )
mdl_lasso$bestTune
```

The summary output shows the model did not tune alpha because I held it at 1 for lasso regression. The optimal tuning values (at the minimum RMSE) were alpha = 1 and lambda = 0.65.  You can see the RMSE minimum on the the plot.

```{r}
ggplot(mdl_ridge) +
  labs(title = "Lasso Regression Parameter Tuning", x = "lambda")
```

## Elastic Net

Elastic Net combines the penalties of ridge and lasso to get the best of both worlds. The loss function for elastic net is

$$L = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n \left(y_i - x_i^{'} \hat\beta \right)^2}{2n} + \lambda \frac{1 - \alpha}{2}\sum_{j=1}^k \hat{\beta}_j^2 + \lambda \alpha\left| \hat{\beta}_j \right|.$$

In this loss function, new parameter $\alpha$ is a "mixing" parameter that balances the two approaches.  If $\alpha$ is zero, you are back to ridge regression, and if $\alpha$ is one, you are back to lasso.


#### Example {-}

Continuing with prediction of `mpg` from the other variables in the `mtcars` data set, follow the same steps as before, but with elastic net regression there are two parameters to optimize: $\lambda$ and $\alpha$.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
mdl_elnet <- train(
  mpg ~ .,
  data = training,
  method = "glmnet",
  metric = "RMSE",
  preProcess = c("center", "scale"),
  tuneGrid = expand.grid(
    .alpha = seq(0, 1, length.out = 10),  # optimize an elnet regression
    .lambda = seq(0, 5, length.out = 101)
  ),
  trControl = train_control
  )
mdl_elnet$bestTune
```

The optimal tuning values (at the mininum RMSE) were alpha = 0.0 and lambda = 2.75, so the mix is 100% ridge, 0% lasso.  You can see the RMSE minimum on the the plot.  Alpha is on the horizontal axis and the different lambdas are shown as separate series.  

```{r}
ggplot(mdl_elnet) +
  labs(title = "Elastic Net Regression Parameter Tuning", x = "lambda")
```


## Model Summary {-}

Make predictions on the validation data set for each of the three models.

```{r}
pr_ridge <- postResample(pred = predict(mdl_ridge, newdata = testing), obs = testing$mpg)
pr_lasso <- postResample(pred = predict(mdl_lasso, newdata = testing), obs = testing$mpg)
pr_elnet <- postResample(pred = predict(mdl_elnet, newdata = testing), obs = testing$mpg)
```

```{r}
rbind(pr_ridge, pr_lasso, pr_elnet)
```

It looks like ridge/elnet was the big winner today based on RMSE and MAE.  Lasso had the best Rsquared though.  On average, ridge/elnet will miss the true value of `mpg` by 3.75 mpg (RMSE) or 2.76 mpg (MAE).  The model explains about 90% of the variation in `mpg`. 

You can also compare the models by resampling.  

```{r}
model.resamples <- resamples(list(Ridge = mdl_ridge,
                                  Lasso = mdl_lasso,
                                  ELNet = mdl_elnet))
summary(model.resamples)
```

You want the smallest mean RMSE, and a small range of RMSEs.  Ridge/elnet had the smallest mean, and a relatively small range.  Boxplots are a common way to visualize this information.  

```{r}
bwplot(model.resamples, metric = "RMSE", main = "Model Comparison on Resamples")
```

Now that you have identified the optimal model, capture its tuning parameters and refit the model to the entire data set.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
mdl_final <- train(
  mpg ~ .,
  data = training,
  method = "glmnet",
  metric = "RMSE",
  preProcess = c("center", "scale"),
  tuneGrid = data.frame(
    .alpha = mdl_ridge$bestTune$alpha,  # optimized hyperparameters
    .lambda = mdl_ridge$bestTune$lambda),  # optimized hyperparameters
  trControl = train_control
  )
mdl_final
```

The model is ready to predict on new data! Here are some final conclusions on the models.

* Lasso can set some coefficients to zero, thus performing variable selection.
* Lasso and Ridge address multicollinearity differently: in ridge regression, the coefficients of correlated predictors are similar; In lasso, one of the correlated predictors has a larger coefficient, while the rest are (nearly) zeroed.
* Lasso tends to do well if there are a small number of significant parameters and the others are close to zero. Ridge tends to work well if there are many large parameters of about the same value.
* In practice, you don't know which will be best, so run cross-validation pick the best.

# Decision Trees

These notes rely on [PSU STAT 508](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat508/).

Decision trees, also known as classification and regression tree (CART) models, are tree-based methods for supervised machine learning.  Simple classification trees and regression trees are easy to use and interpret, but are not competitive with the best machine learning methods. However, they form the foundation for ensemble models such as bagged trees, random forests, and boosted trees, which although less interpretable, are very accurate.

CART models segment the predictor space into $K$ non-overlapping terminal nodes (leaves).  Each node is described by a set of rules which can be used to predict new responses. The predicted value $\hat{y}$ for each node is the mode (classification) or mean (regression).

CART models define the nodes through a *top-down greedy* process called *recursive binary splitting*. The process is *top-down* because it begins at the top of the tree with all observations in a single region and successively splits the predictor space. It is *greedy* because at each splitting step, the best split is made at that particular step without consideration to subsequent splits.

The best split is the predictor variable and cutpoint that minimizes a cost function. The most common cost function for regression trees is the sum of squared residuals, 

$$RSS = \sum_{k=1}^K\sum_{i \in A_k}{\left(y_i - \hat{y}_{A_k} \right)^2}.$$

For classification trees, it is the Gini index, 

$$G = \sum_{c=1}^C{\hat{p}_{kc}(1 - \hat{p}_{kc})},$$

and the entropy (aka information statistic)

$$D = - \sum_{c=1}^C{\hat{p}_{kc} \log \hat{p}_{kc}}$$

where $\hat{p}_{kc}$ is the proportion of training observations in node $k$ that are class $c$.  A completely *pure* node in a binary tree would have $\hat{p} \in \{ 0, 1 \}$ and $G = D = 0$. A completely *impure* node in a binary tree would have $\hat{p} = 0.5$ and $G = 0.5^2 \cdot 2 = 0.25$ and $D = -(0.5 \log(0.5)) \cdot 2 = 0.69$.

CART repeats the splitting process for each child node until a *stopping criterion* is satisfied, usually when no node size surpasses a predefined maximum, or continued splitting does not improve the model significantly.  CART may also impose a minimum number of observations in each node.

The resulting tree likely over-fits the training data and therefore does not generalize well to test data, so CART *prunes* the tree, minimizing the cross-validated prediction error. Rather than cross-validating every possible subtree to find the one with minimum error, CART uses *cost-complexity pruning*. Cost-complexity is the tradeoff between error (cost) and tree size (complexity) where the tradeoff is quantified with cost-complexity parameter $c_p$.  The cost complexity of the tree, $R_{c_p}(T)$, is the sum of its risk (error) plus a "cost complexity" factor $c_p$ multiple of the tree size $|T|$.  

$$R_{c_p}(T) = R(T) + c_p|T|$$

$c_p$ can take on any value from $[0..\infty]$, but it turns out there is an optimal tree for *ranges* of $c_p$ values, so there are only a finite set of *interesting* values for $c_p$ [@James2013] [@Therneau2019] [@Kuhn2016].  A parametric algorithm identifies the interesting $c_p$ values and their associated pruned trees, $T_{c_p}$. CART uses cross-validation to determine which $c_p$ is optimal.


## Classification Tree

You don't usually build a simple classification tree on its own, but it is a good way to build understanding, and the ensemble models build on the logic. I'll learn by example, using the `ISLR::OJ` data set to predict which brand of orange juice, Citrus Hill (CH) or Minute Maid = (MM), customers `Purchase` from its 17 predictor variables.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
library(rpart)  # classification and regression trees 
library(rpart.plot)  # better formatted plots than the ones in rpart

oj_dat <- ISLR::OJ
skimr::skim(oj_dat)
```

I'll split `oj_dat` (n = 1,070) into `oj_train` (80%, n = 857) to fit various models, and `oj_test` (20%, n = 213) to compare their performance on new data.

```{r}
set.seed(12345)
partition <- createDataPartition(y = oj_dat$Purchase, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
oj_train <- oj_dat[partition, ]
oj_test <- oj_dat[-partition, ]
```

Function `rpart::rpart()` builds a full tree, minimizing the Gini index $G$ by default (`parms = list(split = "gini")`), until the stopping criterion is satisfied.  The default stopping criterion is 

* only attempt a split if the current node has at least `minsplit = 20` observations, and
* only accept a split if 
   * the resulting nodes have at least `minbucket = round(minsplit/3)` observations, and 
   * the resulting overall fit improves by `cp = 0.01` (i.e., $\Delta G <= 0.01$).

```{r}
# Use method = "class" for classification, method = "anova" for regression
set.seed(123)
oj_mdl_cart_full <- rpart(formula = Purchase ~ ., data = oj_train, method = "class")
print(oj_mdl_cart_full)
```

The output starts with the root node.  The predicted class at the root is `CH` and this prediction produces 334 errors on the 857 observations for a success rate (accuracy) of 61% (0.61026838) and an error rate of 39% (0.38973162).  The child nodes of node "x" are labeled 2x) and 2x+1), so the child nodes of 1) are 2) and 3), and the child nodes of 2) are 4) and 5).  Terminal nodes are labeled with an asterisk (*).  

Surprisingly, only 3 of the 17 features were used the in full tree: `LoyalCH` (Customer brand loyalty for CH), `PriceDiff` (relative price of MM over CH), and `SalePriceMM` (absolute price of MM).  The first split is at `LoyalCH` = 0.48285.  Here is a diagram of the full (unpruned) tree.

```{r}
rpart.plot(oj_mdl_cart_full, yesno = TRUE)
```

The boxes show the node classification (based on mode), the proportion of observations that are *not* `CH`, and the proportion of observations included in the node. 

`rpart()` not only grew the full tree, it identified the set of cost complexity parameters, and measured the model performance of each corresponding tree using cross-validation. `printcp()` displays the candidate $c_p$ values. You can use this table to decide how to prune the tree.

```{r}
printcp(oj_mdl_cart_full)
```

There are 4 $c_p$ values in this model.  The model with the smallest complexity parameter allows the most splits (`nsplit`).  The highest complexity parameter corresponds to a tree with just a root node.  `rel error` is the error rate relative to the root node.  The root node absolute error is 0.38973162 (the proportion of MM), so its `rel error` is 0.38973162/0.38973162 = 1.0.  That means the absolute error of the full tree (at CP = 0.01) is 0.42814 * 0.38973162 = 0.1669.  You can verify that by calculating the error rate of the predicted values:

```{r}
data.frame(pred = predict(oj_mdl_cart_full, newdata = oj_train, type = "class")) %>%
   mutate(obs = oj_train$Purchase,
          err = if_else(pred != obs, 1, 0)) %>%
   summarize(mean_err = mean(err))
```

Finishing the CP table tour, `xerror` is the relative cross-validated error rate and `xstd` is its standard error. If you want the lowest possible error, then prune to the tree with the smallest relative CV error, $c_p$ = 0.01.  If you want to balance predictive power with simplicity, prune to the smallest tree within 1 SE of the one with the smallest relative error.  The CP table is not super-helpful for finding that tree, so add a column to find it.

```{r}
oj_mdl_cart_full$cptable %>%
   data.frame() %>%
   mutate(
      min_idx = which.min(oj_mdl_cart_full$cptable[, "xerror"]),
      rownum = row_number(),
      xerror_cap = oj_mdl_cart_full$cptable[min_idx, "xerror"] + 
                   oj_mdl_cart_full$cptable[min_idx, "xstd"],
      eval = case_when(rownum == min_idx ~ "min xerror",
                       xerror < xerror_cap ~ "under cap",
                       TRUE ~ "")
   ) %>%
   select(-rownum, -min_idx) 
```

The simplest tree using the 1-SE rule is $c_p = 0.01347305, CV error = `r round(0.4700599*0.38973162, 4)`).  Fortunately, `plotcp()` presents a nice graphical representation of the relationship between `xerror` and `cp`.

```{r}
plotcp(oj_mdl_cart_full, upper = "splits")
```

The dashed line is set at the minimum `xerror` + `xstd`.  The top axis shows the number of splits in the tree.  I'm not sure why the CP values are not the same as in the table (they are close, but not the same).  The figure suggests I should prune to 5 or 3 splits.  I see this curve never really hits a minimum - it is still decreasing at 5 splits.  The default tuning parameter value `cp = 0.01` may be too large, so I'll set it to `cp = 0.001` and start over.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
oj_mdl_cart_full <- rpart(
   formula = Purchase ~ .,
   data = oj_train,
   method = "class",
   cp = 0.001
   )
print(oj_mdl_cart_full)
```

This is a much larger tree.  Did I find a `cp` value that produces a local min?

```{r}
plotcp(oj_mdl_cart_full, upper = "splits")
```

Yes, the min is at CP = 0.011 with 5 splits.  The min + 1 SE is at CP = 0.021 with 3 splits.  I'll prune the tree to 3 splits.

```{r}
oj_mdl_cart <- prune(
   oj_mdl_cart_full,
   cp = oj_mdl_cart_full$cptable[oj_mdl_cart_full$cptable[, 2] == 3, "CP"]
)
rpart.plot(oj_mdl_cart, yesno = TRUE)
```

The most "important" indicator of `Purchase` appears to be `LoyalCH`.  From the **rpart** [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/vignettes/longintro.pdf) (page 12), 

> "An overall measure of variable importance is the sum of the goodness of split measures for each split for which it was the primary variable, plus goodness (adjusted agreement) for all splits in which it was a surrogate."

Surrogates refer to alternative features for a node to handle missing data. For each split, CART evaluates a variety of alternative "surrogate" splits to use when the feature value for the primary split is NA. Surrogate splits are splits that produce results similar to the original split. 

A variable's importance is the sum of the improvement in the overall Gini (or RMSE) measure produced by the nodes in which it appears. Here is the variable importance for this model.

```{r}
oj_mdl_cart$variable.importance %>% 
   data.frame() %>%
   rownames_to_column(var = "Feature") %>%
   rename(Overall = '.') %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(Feature, Overall), y = Overall)) +
   geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = Overall), color = "cadetblue", size = .3) +
   theme_minimal() +
   coord_flip() +
   labs(x = "", y = "", title = "Variable Importance with Simple Classication")
```

`LoyalCH` is by far the most important variable, as expected from its position at the top of the tree, and one level down. 

You can see how the surrogates appear in the model with the `summary()` function.

```{r}
summary(oj_mdl_cart)
```

I'll evaluate the predictions and record the accuracy (correct classification percentage) for comparison to other models. Two ways to evaluate the model are the confusion matrix, and the ROC curve. 


### Measuring Performance

#### Confusion Matrix

Print the confusion matrix with `caret::confusionMatrix()` to see how well does this model performs against the holdout set.

```{r}
oj_preds_cart <- bind_cols(
   predict(oj_mdl_cart, newdata = oj_test, type = "prob"),
   predicted = predict(oj_mdl_cart, newdata = oj_test, type = "class"),
   actual = oj_test$Purchase
)

oj_cm_cart <- confusionMatrix(oj_preds_cart$predicted, reference = oj_preds_cart$actual)
oj_cm_cart
```

The confusion matrix is at the top.  It also includes a lot of statistics.  It's worth getting familiar with the stats.  The model accuracy and 95% CI are calculated from the binomial test.

```{r}
binom.test(x = 113 + 70, n = 213)
```

The "No Information Rate" (NIR) statistic is the class rate for the largest class.  In this case CH is the largest class, so NIR = 130/213 = 0.6103.  "P-Value [Acc > NIR]" is the binomial test that the model accuracy is significantly better than the NIR (i.e., significantly better than just always guessing CH).

```{r}
binom.test(x = 113 + 70, n = 213, p = 130/213, alternative = "greater")
```

The "Accuracy" statistic indicates the model predicts 0.8590 of the observations correctly.  That's good, but less impressive when you consider the prevalence of CH is 0.6103 - you could achieve 61% accuracy just by predicting CH every time. A measure that controls for the prevalence is Cohen's kappa statistic. The kappa statistic is explained [here](https://standardwisdom.com/softwarejournal/2011/12/confusion-matrix-another-single-value-metric-kappa-statistic/). It compares the accuracy to the accuracy of a "random system".  It is defined as

$$\kappa = \frac{Acc - RA}{1-RA}$$

where 

$$RA = \frac{ActFalse \times PredFalse + ActTrue \times PredTrue}{Total \times Total}$$

is the hypothetical probability of a chance agreement.  ActFalse will be the number of "MM" (13 + 70 = 83) and actual true will be the number of "CH" (113 + 17 = 130).  The predicted counts are

```{r}
table(oj_preds_cart$predicted)
```

So, $RA = (83*87 + 130*126) / 213^2 = 0.5202$ and $\kappa = (0.8592 - 0.5202)/(1 - 0.5202) = 0.7064$.  The kappa statistic varies from 0 to 1 where 0 means accurate predictions occur merely by chance, and 1 means the predictions are in perfect agreement with the observations.  In this case, a kappa statistic of 0.7064 is "substantial".  See chart [here](https://www.statisticshowto.datasciencecentral.com/cohens-kappa-statistic/).

The other measures from the `confusionMatrix()` output are various proportions and you can remind yourself of their definitions in the documentation with `?confusionMatrix`.

Visuals are almost always helpful.  Here is a plot of the confusion matrix.

```{r}
plot(oj_preds_cart$actual, oj_preds_cart$predicted, 
     main = "Simple Classification: Predicted vs. Actual",
     xlab = "Actual",
     ylab = "Predicted")
```

#### ROC Curve

The ROC (receiver operating characteristics) curve [@Fawcett2005] is another measure of accuracy.  The ROC curve is a plot of the true positive rate (TPR, sensitivity) versus the false positive rate (FPR, 1 - specificity) for a set of thresholds. By default, the threshold for predicting the default classification is 0.50, but it could be any threshold. `precrec::evalmod()` calculates the confusion matrix values from the model using the holdout data set.  The AUC on the holdout set is 0.8848.  `pRoc::plot.roc()`, `plotROC::geom_roc()`, and `yardstick::roc_curve()` are all options for plotting a ROC curve.

```{r}
mdl_auc <- Metrics::auc(actual = oj_preds_cart$actual == "CH", oj_preds_cart$CH)
yardstick::roc_curve(oj_preds_cart, actual, CH) %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(
    title = "OJ CART ROC Curve",
    subtitle = paste0("AUC = ", round(mdl_auc, 4))
  )
```

A few points on the ROC space are helpful for understanding how to use it.  

* The lower left point (0, 0) is the result of *always* predicting "negative" or in this case "MM" if "CH" is taken as the default class. No false positives, but no true positives either.
* The upper right point (1, 1) is the result of *always* predicting "positive" ("CH" here).  You catch all true positives, but miss all the true negatives.
* The upper left point (0, 1) is the result of perfect accuracy.
* The lower right point (1, 0) is the result of perfect imbecility.  You made the exact wrong prediction every time. 
* The 45 degree diagonal is the result of randomly guessing positive (CH) X percent of the time.  If you guess positive 90% of the time and the prevalence is 50%, your TPR will be 90% and your FPR will also be 90%, etc.

The goal is for all nodes to bunch up in the upper left.

Points to the left of the diagonal with a low TPR can be thought of as "conservative" predictors - they only make positive (CH) predictions with strong evidence.  Points to the left of the diagonal with a high TPR can be thought of as "liberal" predictors - they make positive (CH) predictions with weak evidence.

#### Gain Curve

The gain curve plots the cumulative summed true outcome versus the fraction of items seen when sorted by the predicted value. The “wizard” curve is the gain curve when the data is sorted by the true outcome. If the model’s gain curve is close to the wizard curve, then the model predicted the response variable well. The gray area is the “gain” over a random prediction.

130 of the 213 consumers in the holdout set purchased CH.

* The gain curve encountered 77 CH purchasers (59%) within the first 79 observations (37%). 

* It encountered all 130 CH purchasers on the 213th observation (100%).

* The bottom of the gray area is the outcome of a random model. Only half the CH purchasers would be observed within 50% of the observations. The top of the gray area is the outcome of the perfect model, the “wizard curve”. Half the CH purchasers would be observed in 65/213=31% of the observations.

```{r}
yardstick::gain_curve(oj_preds_cart, actual, CH) %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(
    title = "OJ CART Gain Curve"
  )
```


### Training with Caret

I can also fit the model with `caret::train()`. There are two ways to tune hyperparameters in `train()`: 

* set the number of tuning parameter values to consider by setting `tuneLength`, or
* set particular values to consider for each parameter by defining a `tuneGrid`.

I'll build the model using 10-fold cross-validation to optimize the hyperparameter CP. If you have no idea what is the optimal tuning parameter, start with `tuneLength` to get close, then fine-tune with `tuneGrid`.  That's what I'll do.  I'll create a training control object that I can re-use in other model builds.  

```{r}
oj_trControl = trainControl(
   method = "cv",
   number = 10,
   savePredictions = "final",       # save preds for the optimal tuning parameter
   classProbs = TRUE,  # class probs in addition to preds
   summaryFunction = twoClassSummary
   )
```

Now fit the model.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
oj_mdl_cart2 <- train(
   Purchase ~ ., 
   data = oj_train, 
   method = "rpart",
   tuneLength = 5,
   metric = "ROC",
   trControl = oj_trControl
   )
```

`caret` built a full tree using `rpart`'s default parameters: gini splitting index, at least 20 observations in a node in order to consider splitting it, and at least 6 observations in each node.  Caret then calculated the accuracy for each candidate value of $\alpha$.  Here is the results.

```{r}
print(oj_mdl_cart2)
```

The second `cp` (0.008982036) produced the highest accuracy.  I can drill into the best value of `cp` using a tuning grid.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
oj_mdl_cart2 <- train(
   Purchase ~ ., 
   data = oj_train, 
   method = "rpart",
   tuneGrid = expand.grid(cp = seq(from = 0.001, to = 0.010, length = 11)),  
   metric = "ROC",
   trControl = oj_trControl
   )
print(oj_mdl_cart2)
```

The best model is at cp = 0.0082.  Here are the cross-validated accuracies for the candidate cp values.

```{r}
plot(oj_mdl_cart2)
```

Here are the rules in the final model.  

```{r}
oj_mdl_cart2$finalModel
```

```{r}
rpart.plot(oj_mdl_cart2$finalModel)
```

Let's look at the performance on the holdout data set.

```{r}
oj_preds_cart2 <- bind_cols(
   predict(oj_mdl_cart2, newdata = oj_test, type = "prob"),
   Predicted = predict(oj_mdl_cart2, newdata = oj_test, type = "raw"),
   Actual = oj_test$Purchase
)

oj_cm_cart2 <- confusionMatrix(oj_preds_cart2$Predicted, oj_preds_cart2$Actual)
oj_cm_cart2
```

The accuracy is 0.8451 - a little worse than the 0.8592 from the direct method. The AUC is 0.9102.

```{r}
mdl_auc <- Metrics::auc(actual = oj_preds_cart2$Actual == "CH", oj_preds_cart2$CH)
yardstick::roc_curve(oj_preds_cart2, Actual, CH) %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(
    title = "OJ CART ROC Curve (caret)",
    subtitle = paste0("AUC = ", round(mdl_auc, 4))
  )
```

```{r}
yardstick::gain_curve(oj_preds_cart2, Actual, CH) %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(title = "OJ CART Gain Curve (caret)")
```

Finally, here is the variable importance plot. Brand loyalty is most important, followed by price difference.

```{r}
plot(varImp(oj_mdl_cart2), main="Variable Importance with CART (caret)")
```

Looks like the manual effort fared best.  Here is a summary the accuracy rates of the two models.

```{r}
oj_scoreboard <- rbind(
   data.frame(Model = "Single Tree", Accuracy = oj_cm_cart$overall["Accuracy"]),
   data.frame(Model = "Single Tree (caret)", Accuracy = oj_cm_cart2$overall["Accuracy"])
) %>% arrange(desc(Accuracy))
scoreboard(oj_scoreboard)
```


## Regression Tree

A simple regression tree is built in a manner similar to a simple classification tree, and like the simple classification tree, it is rarely invoked on its own; the bagged, random forest, and gradient boosting methods build on this logic.  I'll learn by example again. Using the `ISLR::Carseats` data set, and predict `Sales` using from the 10 feature variables.

```{r}
cs_dat <- ISLR::Carseats
skimr::skim(cs_dat)
```

Split `careseats_dat` (n = 400) into `cs_train` (80%, n = 321) and `cs_test` (20%, n = 79).

```{r}
set.seed(12345)
partition <- createDataPartition(y = cs_dat$Sales, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
cs_train <- cs_dat[partition, ]
cs_test <- cs_dat[-partition, ]
```

The first step is to build a full tree, then perform k-fold cross-validation to help select the optimal cost complexity (cp). The only difference here is the `rpart()` parameter `method = "anova"` to produce a regression tree.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
cs_mdl_cart_full <- rpart(Sales ~ ., cs_train, method = "anova")
print(cs_mdl_cart_full)
```

The predicted `Sales` at the root is the mean `Sales` for the training data set, 7.535950 (values are $000s). The deviance at the root is the SSE, 2567.768. The first split is at `ShelveLoc` = [Bad, Medium] vs Good.  Here is the unpruned tree diagram.

```{r}
rpart.plot(cs_mdl_cart_full, yesno = TRUE)
```

The boxes show the node predicted value (mean) and the proportion of observations that are in the node (or child nodes). 

`rpart()` grew the full tree, and used cross-validation to test the performance of the possible complexity hyperparameters. `printcp()` displays the candidate cp values. You can use this table to decide how to prune the tree.

```{r}
printcp(cs_mdl_cart_full)
```

There were 16 possible cp values in this model. The model with the smallest complexity parameter allows the most splits (`nsplit`).  The highest complexity parameter corresponds to a tree with just a root node.  `rel error` is the SSE relative to the root node.  The root node SSE is 2567.76800, so its `rel error` is 2567.76800/2567.76800 = 1.0.  That means the absolute error of the full tree (at CP = 0.01) is 0.30963 * 2567.76800 = 795.058. You can verify that by calculating the SSE of the model predicted values:

```{r}
data.frame(pred = predict(cs_mdl_cart_full, newdata = cs_train)) %>%
   mutate(obs = cs_train$Sales,
          sq_err = (obs - pred)^2) %>%
   summarize(sse = sum(sq_err))
```

Finishing the CP table tour, `xerror` is the cross-validated SSE and `xstd` is its standard error. If you want the lowest possible error, then prune to the tree with the smallest relative SSE (`xerror`).  If you want to balance predictive power with simplicity, prune to the smallest tree within 1 SE of the one with the smallest relative SSE.  The CP table is not super-helpful for finding that tree. I'll add a column to find it.

```{r}
cs_mdl_cart_full$cptable %>%
   data.frame() %>%
   mutate(min_xerror_idx = which.min(cs_mdl_cart_full$cptable[, "xerror"]),
          rownum = row_number(),
          xerror_cap = cs_mdl_cart_full$cptable[min_xerror_idx, "xerror"] + 
             cs_mdl_cart_full$cptable[min_xerror_idx, "xstd"],
          eval = case_when(rownum == min_xerror_idx ~ "min xerror",
                           xerror < xerror_cap ~ "under cap",
                           TRUE ~ "")) %>%
   select(-rownum, -min_xerror_idx) 
```

Okay, so the simplest tree is the one with CP = 0.02599265 (5 splits).  Fortunately, `plotcp()` presents a nice graphical representation of the relationship between `xerror` and `cp`.

```{r}
plotcp(cs_mdl_cart_full, upper = "splits")
```

The dashed line is set at the minimum `xerror` + `xstd`.  The top axis shows the number of splits in the tree.  I'm not sure why the CP values are not the same as in the table (they are close, but not the same).  The smallest relative error is at CP = 0.01000000 (15 splits), but the maximum CP below the dashed line (one standard deviation above the minimum error) is at CP = 0.02599265 (5 splits). Use the `prune()` function to prune the tree by specifying the associated cost-complexity `cp`.  

```{r}
cs_mdl_cart <- prune(
   cs_mdl_cart_full,
   cp = cs_mdl_cart_full$cptable[cs_mdl_cart_full$cptable[, 2] == 5, "CP"]
)
rpart.plot(cs_mdl_cart, yesno = TRUE)
```

The most "important" indicator of `Sales` is `ShelveLoc`.  Here are the importance values from the model. 

```{r}
cs_mdl_cart$variable.importance %>% 
   data.frame() %>%
   rownames_to_column(var = "Feature") %>%
   rename(Overall = '.') %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(Feature, Overall), y = Overall)) +
   geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = Overall), color = "cadetblue", size = .3) +
   theme_minimal() +
   coord_flip() +
   labs(x = "", y = "", title = "Variable Importance with Simple Regression")
```

The most important indicator of `Sales` is `ShelveLoc`, then `Price`, then `Age`, all of which appear in the final model.  `CompPrice` was also important.

The last step is to make predictions on the validation data set. The root mean squared error ($RMSE = \sqrt{(1/2) \sum{(actual - pred)^2}})$ and mean absolute error ($MAE = (1/n) \sum{|actual - pred|}$) are the two most common measures of predictive accuracy. The key difference is that RMSE punishes large errors more harshly. For a regression tree, set argument `type = "vector"` (or do not specify at all). 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cs_preds_cart <- predict(cs_mdl_cart, cs_test, type = "vector")

cs_rmse_cart <- RMSE(
   pred = cs_preds_cart,
   obs = cs_test$Sales
)
cs_rmse_cart
```

The pruning process leads to an average prediction error of 2.363 in the test data set.  Not too bad considering the standard deviation of `Sales` is `r round(sd(cs_test$Sales), 3)`. Here is a predicted vs actual plot. 

```{r}
data.frame(Predicted = cs_preds_cart, Actual = cs_test$Sales) %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = Actual, y = Predicted)) +
   geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "cadetblue") +
   geom_smooth() +
   geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = 2) +
   labs(title = "Carseats CART, Predicted vs Actual")
```

The 6 possible predicted values do a decent job of binning the observations.


### Training with Caret

I can also fit the model with `caret::train()`, specifying `method = "rpart"`. I'll build the model using 10-fold cross-validation to optimize the hyperparameter CP. 

```{r}
cs_trControl = trainControl(
   method = "cv",
   number = 10,
   savePredictions = "final"       # save predictions for the optimal tuning parameter
)
```


I'll let the model look for the best CP tuning parameter with `tuneLength` to get close, then fine-tune with `tuneGrid`.  

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
cs_mdl_cart2 = train(
   Sales ~ ., 
   data = cs_train, 
   method = "rpart",
   tuneLength = 5,
   metric = "RMSE",
   trControl = cs_trControl
)
print(cs_mdl_cart2)
```

The first `cp` (0.04167149) produced the smallest RMSE.  I can drill into the best value of `cp` using a tuning grid.  I'll try that now.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
cs_mdl_cart2 = train(
   Sales ~ ., 
   data = cs_train, 
   method = "rpart",
   tuneGrid = expand.grid(cp = seq(from = 0, to = 0.1, by = 0.01)),
   metric = "RMSE",
   trControl = cs_trControl
)
print(cs_mdl_cart2)
```

It looks like the best performing tree is the unpruned one.

```{r}
plot(cs_mdl_cart2)
```

Let's see the final model.

```{r}
rpart.plot(cs_mdl_cart2$finalModel)
```

What were the most important variables?

```{r}
plot(varImp(cs_mdl_cart2), main="Variable Importance with Simple Regression")
```

Evaluate the model by making predictions with the test data set.  

```{r}
cs_preds_cart2 <- predict(cs_mdl_cart2, cs_test, type = "raw")
data.frame(Actual = cs_test$Sales, Predicted = cs_preds_cart2) %>%
ggplot(aes(x = Actual, y = Predicted)) +
   geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "cadetblue") +
   geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = "y ~ x") +
   geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = 2) +
   labs(title = "Carseats CART, Predicted vs Actual (caret)")
```

The model over-estimates at the low end and underestimates at the high end.  Calculate the test data set RMSE.

```{r}
(cs_rmse_cart2 <- RMSE(pred = cs_preds_cart2, obs = cs_test$Sales))
```

Caret performed better in this model.  Here is a summary the RMSE values of the two models.

```{r}
cs_scoreboard <- rbind(
   data.frame(Model = "Single Tree", RMSE = cs_rmse_cart),
   data.frame(Model = "Single Tree (caret)", RMSE = cs_rmse_cart2)
) %>% arrange(RMSE)
scoreboard(cs_scoreboard)
```


## Bagged Trees

One drawback of decision trees is that they are high-variance estimators. A small number of additional training observations can dramatically alter the prediction performance of a learned tree.

Bootstrap aggregation, or *bagging*, is a general-purpose procedure for reducing the variance of a statistical learning method.  The algorithm constructs *B* regression trees using *B* bootstrapped training sets, and averages the resulting predictions. These trees are grown deep, and are not pruned. Hence each individual tree has high variance, but low bias. Averaging the *B* trees reduces the variance.  The predicted value for an observation is the mode (classification) or mean (regression) of the trees. *B* usually equals ~25.

To test the model accuracy, the out-of-bag observations are predicted from the models. For a training set of size *n*, each tree is composed of $\sim (1 - e^{-1})n = .632n$ unique observations in-bag and $.368n$ out-of-bag. For each tree in the ensemble, bagging makes predictions on the tree's out-of-bag observations. I think (*see* page 197 of [@Kuhn2016]) bagging measures the performance (RMSE, Accuracy, ROC, etc.) of each tree in the ensemble and averages them to produce an overall performance estimate. (This makes no sense to me. If each tree has poor performance, then the average performance of many trees will still be poor. An ensemble of *B* trees will produce $\sim .368 B$ predictions per unique observation. Seems like you should take the mean/mode of each observation's prediction as the final prediction. Then you have *n* predictions to compare to *n* actuals, and you assess performance on that.)

The downside to bagging is that there is no single tree with a set of rules to interpret. It becomes unclear which variables are more important than others. 

The next section explains how bagged trees are a special case of random forests.

### Bagged Classification Tree

Leaning by example, I'll predict `Purchase` from the `OJ` data set again, this time using the bagging method by specifying `method = "treebag"`. Caret has no hyperparameters to tune with this model, so I won't set `tuneLegth` or `tuneGrid`. The ensemble size defaults to `nbagg = 25`, but you can override it (I didn't).

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
oj_mdl_bag <- train(
   Purchase ~ ., 
   data = oj_train, 
   method = "treebag",
   trControl = oj_trControl,
   metric = "ROC"
)
oj_mdl_bag$finalModel
oj_mdl_bag
# summary(oj_mdl_bag)
```

If you review the `summary(oj_mdl_bag)`, you'll see that caret built *B* = 25 trees from 25 bootstrapped training sets of 857 samples (the size of `oj_train`). I *think* caret started by splitting the training set into 10 folds, then using 9 of the folds to run the bagging algorithm and collect performance measures on the hold-out fold. After repeating the process for all 10 folds, it averaged the performance measures to produce the resampling results shown above. Had there been hyperparameters to tune, caret would have repeated this process for all hyperparameter combinations and the resampling results above would be from the best performing combination. Then caret ran the bagging algorithm again on the *entire* data set, and the trees you see in `summary(oj_mdl_bag)` are what it produces. (*It seems inefficient to cross-validate a bagging algorithm given that the out-of-bag samples are there for performance testing.*)

Let's look at the performance on the holdout data set.

```{r}
oj_preds_bag <- bind_cols(
   predict(oj_mdl_bag, newdata = oj_test, type = "prob"),
   Predicted = predict(oj_mdl_bag, newdata = oj_test, type = "raw"),
   Actual = oj_test$Purchase
)

oj_cm_bag <- confusionMatrix(oj_preds_bag$Predicted, reference = oj_preds_bag$Actual)
oj_cm_bag
```

The accuracy is 0.8451 - surprisingly worse than the 0.85915 of the single tree model, but that is a difference of three predictions in a set of 213. Here are the ROC and gain curves.

```{r}
mdl_auc <- Metrics::auc(actual = oj_preds_bag$Actual == "CH", oj_preds_bag$CH)
yardstick::roc_curve(oj_preds_bag, Actual, CH) %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(
    title = "OJ Bagging ROC Curve",
    subtitle = paste0("AUC = ", round(mdl_auc, 4))
  )

yardstick::gain_curve(oj_preds_bag, Actual, CH) %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(title = "OJ Bagging Gain Curve")
```

Let's see what are the most important variables.

```{r}
plot(varImp(oj_mdl_bag), main="Variable Importance with Bagging")
```
Finally, let's check out the scoreboard. Bagging fared worse than the single tree models.

```{r}
oj_scoreboard <- rbind(oj_scoreboard,
   data.frame(Model = "Bagging", Accuracy = oj_cm_bag$overall["Accuracy"])
) %>% arrange(desc(Accuracy))
scoreboard(oj_scoreboard)
```

### Bagging Regression Tree

I'll predict `Sales` from the `Carseats` data set again, this time using the bagging method by specifying `method = "treebag"`.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
cs_mdl_bag <- train(
   Sales ~ ., 
   data = cs_train, 
   method = "treebag",
   trControl = cs_trControl
)
cs_mdl_bag
```

Let's look at the performance on the holdout data set. The RMSE is 1.9185, but the model over-predicts at low end of Sales and under-predicts at high end.

```{r}
cs_preds_bag <- bind_cols(
   Predicted = predict(cs_mdl_bag, newdata = cs_test),
   Actual = cs_test$Sales
)
(cs_rmse_bag <- RMSE(pred = cs_preds_bag$Predicted, obs = cs_preds_bag$Actual))

cs_preds_bag %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = Actual, y = Predicted)) +
   geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "cadetblue") +
   geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = "y ~ x") +
   geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = 2) +
   labs(title = "Carseats Bagging, Predicted vs Actual (caret)")
```

Now the variable importance.

```{r}
plot(varImp(cs_mdl_bag), main="Variable Importance with Bagging")
```

Before moving on, check in with the scoreboard.

```{r}
cs_scoreboard <- rbind(cs_scoreboard,
   data.frame(Model = "Bagging", RMSE = cs_rmse_bag)
) %>% arrange(RMSE)
scoreboard(cs_scoreboard)
```

## Random Forests

Random forests improve bagged trees by way of a small tweak that de-correlates the trees.  As in bagging, the algorithm builds a number of decision trees on bootstrapped training samples. But when building these decision trees, each time a split in a tree is considered, a random sample of *mtry* predictors is chosen as split candidates from the full set of *p* predictors.  A fresh sample of *mtry* predictors is taken at each split.  Typically $mtry \sim \sqrt{p}$.  Bagged trees are thus a special case of random forests where *mtry = p*.

#### Random Forest Classification Tree

Now I'll try it with the random forest method by specifying `method = "rf"`.  Hyperparameter `mtry` can take any value from 1 to 17 (the number of predictors) and I expect the best value to be near $\sqrt{17} \sim 4$.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
oj_mdl_rf <- train(
   Purchase ~ ., 
   data = oj_train, 
   method = "rf",
   metric = "ROC",
   tuneGrid = expand.grid(mtry = 1:10), # searching around mtry=4
   trControl = oj_trControl
)
oj_mdl_rf
```

The largest ROC score was at mtry = 7 - higher than I expected.

```{r}
plot(oj_mdl_rf)
```

Use the model to make predictions on the test set. 

```{r}
oj_preds_rf <- bind_cols(
   predict(oj_mdl_rf, newdata = oj_test, type = "prob"),
   Predicted = predict(oj_mdl_rf, newdata = oj_test, type = "raw"),
   Actual = oj_test$Purchase
)

oj_cm_rf <- confusionMatrix(oj_preds_rf$Predicted, reference = oj_preds_rf$Actual)
oj_cm_rf
```

The accuracy on the holdout set is 0.8310. The AUC is 0.9244. Here are the ROC and gain curves.

```{r}
# AUC is 0.9190
mdl_auc <- Metrics::auc(actual = oj_preds_rf$Actual == "CH", oj_preds_rf$CH)
yardstick::roc_curve(oj_preds_rf, Actual, CH) %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(
    title = "OJ Random Forest ROC Curve",
    subtitle = paste0("AUC = ", round(mdl_auc, 4))
  )

yardstick::gain_curve(oj_preds_rf, Actual, CH) %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(title = "OJ Random Forest Gain Curve")
```

What are the most important variables?

```{r}
plot(varImp(oj_mdl_rf), main="Variable Importance with Random Forest")
```

Let's update the scoreboard. The bagging and random forest models did pretty well, but the manual classification tree is still in first place.  There's still gradient boosting to investigate!

```{r}
oj_scoreboard <- rbind(oj_scoreboard,
   data.frame(Model = "Random Forest", Accuracy = oj_cm_rf$overall["Accuracy"])
) %>% arrange(desc(Accuracy))
scoreboard(oj_scoreboard)
```

#### Random Forest Regression Tree

Now I'll try it with the random forest method by specifying `method = "rf"`.  Hyperparameter `mtry` can take any value from 1 to 10 (the number of predictors) and I expect the best value to be near $\sqrt{10} \sim 3$.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
cs_mdl_rf <- train(
   Sales ~ ., 
   data = cs_train, 
   method = "rf",
   tuneGrid = expand.grid(mtry = 1:10), # searching around mtry=3
   trControl = cs_trControl
)
cs_mdl_rf
```

The minimum RMSE is at mtry = 7.

```{r}
plot(cs_mdl_rf)
```

Make predictions on the test set. Like the bagged tree model, this one also over-predicts at low end of Sales and under-predicts at high end. The RMSE of 1.7184 is better than bagging's 1.9185.

```{r}
cs_preds_rf <- bind_cols(
   Predicted = predict(cs_mdl_rf, newdata = cs_test),
   Actual = cs_test$Sales
)
(cs_rmse_rf <- RMSE(pred = cs_preds_rf$Predicted, obs = cs_preds_rf$Actual))

cs_preds_rf %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = Actual, y = Predicted)) +
   geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "cadetblue") +
   geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = "y ~ x") +
   geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = 2) +
   labs(title = "Carseats Random Forest, Predicted vs Actual (caret)")
```

```{r}
plot(varImp(cs_mdl_rf), main="Variable Importance with Random Forest")
```

Let's check in with the scoreboard.

```{r}
cs_scoreboard <- rbind(cs_scoreboard,
   data.frame(Model = "Random Forest", RMSE = cs_rmse_rf)
) %>% arrange(RMSE)
scoreboard(cs_scoreboard)
```

The bagging and random forest models did very well - they took over the top positions!

## Gradient Boosting

**Note**: I learned gradient boosting from [explained.ai](https://explained.ai/gradient-boosting/L2-loss.html).

Gradient boosting machine (GBM) is an additive modeling algorithm that gradually builds a composite model by iteratively adding *M* weak sub-models based on the performance of the prior iteration's composite,

$$F_M(x) = \sum_m^M f_m(x).$$

The idea is to fit a weak model, then replace the response values with the residuals from that model, and fit another model. Adding the residual prediction model to the original response prediction model produces a more accurate model. GBM repeats this process over and over, running new models to predict the residuals of the previous composite models, and adding the results to produce new composites. With each iteration, the model becomes stronger and stronger. The successive trees are usually weighted to slow down the learning rate. "Shrinkage" reduces the influence of each individual tree and leaves space for future trees to improve the model.

$$F_M(x) = f_0 + \eta\sum_{m = 1}^M f_m(x).$$

The smaller the learning rate, $\eta$, the larger the number of trees, $M$. $\eta$ and $M$ are hyperparameters. Other constraints to the trees are usually applied as additional hyperparameters, including, tree depth, number of nodes, minimum observations per split, and minimum improvement to loss.

The name "gradient boosting" refers to the *boosting* of a model with a *gradient*. Each round of training builds a *weak learner* and uses the residuals to calculate a gradient, the partial derivative of the loss function. Gradient boosting "descends the gradient" to adjust the model parameters to reduce the error in the next round of training.

In the case of classification problems, the loss function is the log-loss; for regression problems, the loss function is mean squared error. GBM continues until it reaches maximum number of trees or an acceptable error level.


#### Gradient Boosting Classification Tree

In addition to the gradient boosting machine algorithm, implemented in **caret** with `method = gbm`, there is a variable called Extreme Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, which frankly I don't know anything about other than it is supposed to work extremely well. Let's try them both!

##### GBM

I'll predict `Purchase` from the `OJ` data set again, this time using the GBM method by specifying `method = "gbm"`. `gbm` has the following tuneable hyperparameters (see `modelLookup("gbm")`). 

* `n.trees`: number of boosting iterations, $M$
* `interaction.depth`: maximum tree depth
* `shrinkage`: shrinkage, $\eta$
* `n.minobsinnode`: minimum terminal node size

I'll use `tuneLength = 5`.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
garbage <- capture.output(
oj_mdl_gbm <- train(
   Purchase ~ ., 
   data = oj_train, 
   method = "gbm",
   metric = "ROC",
   tuneLength = 5,
   trControl = oj_trControl
))
oj_mdl_gbm
```

`train()` tuned `n.trees` ($M) and `interaction.depth`, holding `shrinkage = 0.1` (\eta), and `n.minobsinnode = 10`. The optimal hyperparameter values were `n.trees = 50`, and `interaction.depth = 5`.

You can see from the tuning plot that accuracy is maximized at $M=50$ for tree depth of 5, but $M=50$ with tree depth of 3 worked nearly as well.

```{r}
plot(oj_mdl_gbm)
```

Let's see how the model performed on the holdout set. The accuracy was 0.8451.

```{r}
oj_preds_gbm <- bind_cols(
   predict(oj_mdl_gbm, newdata = oj_test, type = "prob"),
   Predicted = predict(oj_mdl_gbm, newdata = oj_test, type = "raw"),
   Actual = oj_test$Purchase
)

oj_cm_gbm <- confusionMatrix(oj_preds_gbm$Predicted, reference = oj_preds_gbm$Actual)
oj_cm_gbm
```

AUC was 0.9386. Here are the ROC and gain curves.

```{r}
mdl_auc <- Metrics::auc(actual = oj_preds_gbm$Actual == "CH", oj_preds_gbm$CH)
yardstick::roc_curve(oj_preds_gbm, Actual, CH) %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(
    title = "OJ GBM ROC Curve",
    subtitle = paste0("AUC = ", round(mdl_auc, 4))
  )

yardstick::gain_curve(oj_preds_gbm, Actual, CH) %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(title = "OJ GBM Gain Curve")
```

Now the variable importance. Just a few variables. `LoyalCH` is at the top again.

```{r}
#plot(varImp(oj_mdl_gbm), main="Variable Importance with Gradient Boosting")
```

##### XGBoost

I'll predict `Purchase` from the `OJ` data set again, this time using the XGBoost method by specifying `method = "xgbTree"`. `xgbTree` has the following tuneable hyperparameters (see `modelLookup("xgbTree")`). The first three are the same as `xgb`.

* `nrounds`: number of boosting iterations, $M$
* `max_depth`: maximum tree depth
* `eta`: shrinkage, $\eta$
* `gamma`: minimum loss reduction
* `colsamle_bytree`: subsample ratio of columns
* `min_child_weight`: minimum size of instance weight
* `substample`: subsample percentage

I'll use `tuneLength = 5` again.

```{r cart-xgb-oj}
set.seed(1234)
garbage <- capture.output(
oj_mdl_xgb <- train(
   Purchase ~ ., 
   data = oj_train, 
   method = "xgbTree",
   metric = "ROC",
   tuneLength = 5,
   trControl = oj_trControl
))
oj_mdl_xgb
```

`train()` tuned `eta` ($\eta$),  `max_depth`, `colsample_bytree`, `subsample`, and `nrounds`, holding `gamma = 0`, and `min_child_weight = 1`. The optimal hyperparameter values were `eta = 0.3`,  `max_depth - 1`, `colsample_bytree = 0.6`, `subsample = 1`, and `nrounds = 50`.

With so many hyperparameters, the tuning plot is nearly unreadable.

```{r}
#plot(oj_mdl_xgb)
```

Let's see how the model performed on the holdout set. The accuracy was 0.8732 - much better than the 0.8451 from regular gradient boosting.

```{r}
oj_preds_xgb <- bind_cols(
   predict(oj_mdl_xgb, newdata = oj_test, type = "prob"),
   Predicted = predict(oj_mdl_xgb, newdata = oj_test, type = "raw"),
   Actual = oj_test$Purchase
)

oj_cm_xgb <- confusionMatrix(oj_preds_xgb$Predicted, reference = oj_preds_xgb$Actual)
oj_cm_xgb
```

AUC was 0.9386 for gradient boosting, and here it is 0.9323. Here are the ROC and gain curves.

```{r}
mdl_auc <- Metrics::auc(actual = oj_preds_xgb$Actual == "CH", oj_preds_xgb$CH)
yardstick::roc_curve(oj_preds_xgb, Actual, CH) %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(
    title = "OJ XGBoost ROC Curve",
    subtitle = paste0("AUC = ", round(mdl_auc, 4))
  )

yardstick::gain_curve(oj_preds_xgb, Actual, CH) %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(title = "OJ XGBoost Gain Curve")
```

Now the variable importance. Nothing jumps out at me here. It's the same top variables as regular gradient boosting.

```{r}
plot(varImp(oj_mdl_xgb), main="Variable Importance with XGBoost")
```

Okay, let's check in with the leader board. Wow, XGBoost *is* extreme.

```{r}
oj_scoreboard <- rbind(oj_scoreboard,
   data.frame(Model = "Gradient Boosting", Accuracy = oj_cm_gbm$overall["Accuracy"])) %>%
   rbind(data.frame(Model = "XGBoost", Accuracy = oj_cm_xgb$overall["Accuracy"])) %>%
arrange(desc(Accuracy))
scoreboard(oj_scoreboard)
```


#### Gradient Boosting Regression Tree

##### GBM

I'll predict `Sales` from the `Carseats` data set again, this time using the bagging method by specifying `method = "gbm"`

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
garbage <- capture.output(
cs_mdl_gbm <- train(
   Sales ~ ., 
   data = cs_train, 
   method = "gbm",
   tuneLength = 5,
   trControl = cs_trControl
))
cs_mdl_gbm
```

The optimal tuning parameters were at $M = 250$ and `interation.depth = 1`.

```{r}
plot(cs_mdl_gbm)
```

Here is the holdout set performance.

```{r}
cs_preds_gbm <- bind_cols(
   Predicted = predict(cs_mdl_gbm, newdata = cs_test),
   Actual = cs_test$Sales
)

# Model over-predicts at low end of Sales and under-predicts at high end
cs_preds_gbm %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = Actual, y = Predicted)) +
   geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "cadetblue") +
   geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = "y ~ x") +
   geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = 2) +
   labs(title = "Carseats GBM, Predicted vs Actual")
```

```{r}
#plot(varImp(cs_mdl_gbm), main="Variable Importance with GBM")
```

The RMSE is 1.438 - the best of the bunch.

```{r}
cs_rmse_gbm <- RMSE(pred = cs_preds_gbm$Predicted, obs = cs_preds_gbm$Actual)
cs_scoreboard <- rbind(cs_scoreboard,
   data.frame(Model = "GBM", RMSE = cs_rmse_gbm)
) %>% arrange(RMSE)
scoreboard(cs_scoreboard)
```

##### XGBoost

I'll predict `Sales` from the `Carseats` data set again, this time using the bagging method by specifying `method = "xgb"`

```{r cart-xgb-cs}
set.seed(1234)
garbage <- capture.output(
cs_mdl_xgb <- train(
   Sales ~ ., 
   data = cs_train, 
   method = "xgbTree",
   tuneLength = 5,
   trControl = cs_trControl
))
cs_mdl_xgb
```

The optimal tuning parameters were at $M = 250$ and `interation.depth = 1`.
`train()` tuned `eta` ($\eta$),  `max_depth`, `gamma`, `colsample_bytree`, `subsample`, and `nrounds`, holding `gamma = 0`, and `min_child_weight = 1`. The optimal hyperparameter values were `eta = 0.4`,  `max_depth = 1`, `gamma = 0`, `colsample_bytree = 0.8`, `subsample = 1`, and `nrounds = 150`.

With so many hyperparameters, the tuning plot is nearly unreadable.

```{r}
#plot(cs_mdl_xgb)
```

Here is the holdout set performance.

```{r}
cs_preds_xgb <- bind_cols(
   Predicted = predict(cs_mdl_xgb, newdata = cs_test),
   Actual = cs_test$Sales
)

# Model over-predicts at low end of Sales and under-predicts at high end
cs_preds_xgb %>%
   ggplot(aes(x = Actual, y = Predicted)) +
   geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "cadetblue") +
   geom_smooth(method = "loess", formula = "y ~ x") +
   geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = 2) +
   labs(title = "Carseats XGBoost, Predicted vs Actual")
```

```{r}
plot(varImp(cs_mdl_xgb), main="Variable Importance with XGBoost")
```

The RMSE is 1.438 - the best of the bunch.

```{r}
cs_rmse_xgb <- RMSE(pred = cs_preds_xgb$Predicted, obs = cs_preds_xgb$Actual)
cs_scoreboard <- rbind(cs_scoreboard,
   data.frame(Model = "XGBoost", RMSE = cs_rmse_xgb)
) %>% arrange(RMSE)
scoreboard(cs_scoreboard)
```


## Summary

I created four classification trees using the `ISLR::OJ` data set and four regression trees using the `ISLR::Carseats` data set. Let's compare their performance.

### Classification Trees

The `caret::resamples()` function summarizes the resampling performance on the final model produced in `train()`. It creates summary statistics (mean, min, max, etc.) for each performance metric (ROC, RMSE, etc.) for a list of models.

```{r}
oj_resamples <- resamples(list("Single Tree (caret)" = oj_mdl_cart2,
                               "Bagged" = oj_mdl_bag,
                               "Random Forest" = oj_mdl_rf,
                               "GBM" = oj_mdl_gbm,
                               "XGBoost" = oj_mdl_xgb))
summary(oj_resamples)
```

The mean ROC value is the performance measure I used to evaluate the models in `train()` (you can compare the Mean column to each model's object (e.g., `print(oj_mdl_cart2)`)). The best performing model on resamples based on the mean ROC score was XGBoost. It also had the highest mean sensitivity. GBM had the highest specificity. Here is a box plot of the distributions.

```{r}
bwplot(oj_resamples)
```

One way to evaluate the box plots is with a post-hoc test of differences. The single tree was about the same as the random forest and bagged models. GBM and XGBoost were also statistically equivalent.

```{r}
(oj_diff <- diff(oj_resamples))
# summary(oj_diff)
dotplot(oj_diff)
```

### Regression Trees

Here is the summary of resampling metrics for the Carseats models.

```{r}
cs_resamples <- resamples(list("Single Tree (caret)" = cs_mdl_cart2,
                               "Bagged" = cs_mdl_bag,
                               "Random Forest" = cs_mdl_rf,
                               "GBM" = cs_mdl_gbm,
                               "XGBoost" = cs_mdl_xgb))
summary(cs_resamples)
```

The best performing model on resamples based on the mean RMSE score was XGBoost. It also had the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) and highest R-squared. Here is a box plot of the distributions.

```{r}
bwplot(cs_resamples)
```

The post-hoc test indicates all models differed from each other except for GBM and XGBoost.

```{r}
(cs_diff <- diff(cs_resamples))
# summary(cs_diff)
dotplot(cs_diff)
```

# Non-linear Models

Linear methods can model nonlinear relationships by including polynomial terms, interaction effects, and variable transformations.  However, it is often difficult to identify how to formulate the model. Nonlinear models may be preferable because you do not need to know the the exact form of the nonlinearity prior to model training.

## Splines

A regression spline fits a piecewise polynomial to the range of *X* partitioned by *knots* (*K* knots produce *K + 1* piecewise polynomials) **James et al** [@James2013].  The polynomials can be of any degree *d*, but are usually in the range [0, 3], most commonly 3 (a cubic spline).  To avoid discontinuities in the fit, a degree-*d* spline is constrained to have continuity in derivatives up to degree *d*−1 at each knot.

A cubic spline fit to a data set with *K* knots, performs least squares regression with an intercept and 3 + *K* predictors, of the form 

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2X^2 + \beta_3X^3 + \beta_4h(X, \xi_1) + \beta_5h(X, \xi_2) + \dots + \beta_{K+3}h(X, \xi_K)$$

where $\xi_1, \dots, \xi_K$ are the knots are truncated power basis functions $h(X, \xi) = (X - \xi)^3$ if $X > \xi$, else 0.

Splines can have high variance at the outer range of the predictors.  A **natural spline** is a regression spline additionally constrained to be linear at the boundaries.

How many knots should there be, and Where should the knots be placed?  It is common to place knots in a uniform fashion, with equal numbers of points between each knot.  The number of knots is typically chosen by trial and error using cross-validation to minimize the RSS.  The number of knots is usually expressed in terms of degrees of freedom.  A cubic spline will have *K* + 3 + 1 degrees of freedom.  A natural spline has *K* + 3 + 1 - 5 degrees of freedom due to the constraints at the endpoints.

A further constraint can be added to reduce overfitting by enforcing smoothness in the spline.  Instead of minimizing the loss function $\sum{(y - g(x))^2}$ where $g(x)$ is a natural spline, minimize a loss function with an additional penalty for variability:

$$L = \sum{(y_i - g(x_i))^2 + \lambda \int g''(t)^2dt}.$$

The function $g(x)$ that minimizes the loss function is a *natural cubic spline* with knots at each $x_1, \dots, x_n$. This is called a **smoothing spline**.  The larger g is, the greater the penalty on variation in the spline.  In a smoothing spline, you do not optimize the number or location of the knots -- there is a knot at each training observation. Instead, you optimize $\lambda$. One way to optimze $\lambda$ is cross-validation to minimize RSS. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) can be computed efficiently for smoothing splines.


## MARS

Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is a non-parametric algorithm that creates a piecewise linear model to capture nonlinearities and interactions effects. The resulting model is a weighted sum of *basis* functions $B_i(X)$:

$$\hat{y} = \sum_{i=1}^{k}{w_iB_i(x)}$$

The basis functions are either a constant (for the intercept), a *hinge* function of the form $\max(0, x - x_0)$ or $\max(0, x_0 - x)$ (a more concise representation is $[\pm(x - x_0)]_+$), or products of two or more hinge functions (for interactions).  MARS automatically selects which predictors to use and what predictor values to serve as the *knots* of the hinge functions.

MARS builds a model in two phases: the forward pass and the backward pass, similar to growing and pruning of tree models. MARS starts with a model consisting of just the intercept term equaling the mean of the response values.  It then asseses every predictor to find a basis function pair consisting of opposing sides of a mirrored hinge function which produces the maximum improvement in the model error.  MARS repeats the process until either it reaches a predefined limit of terms or the error improvement reaches a predefined limit.  MARS generalizes the model by removing terms according to the generalized cross validation (GCV) criterion.  GCV is a form of regularization: it trades off goodness-of-fit against model complexity. 

The `earth::earth()` function ([documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/earth/versions/5.1.2/topics/earth)) performs the MARS algorithm (*the term "MARS" is trademarked, so open-source implementations use "Earth" instead*).  The caret implementation tunes two parameters: `nprune` and `degree`.  `nprune` is the maximum number of terms in the pruned model.  `degree` is the maximum degree of interaction (default is 1 (no interactions)).  However, there are other hyperparameters in the model that may improve performance, including `minspan` which regulates the number of knots in the predictors.

Here is an example using the Ames housing data set (following [this](http://uc-r.github.io/mars) tutorial. 

```{r model_mars, cache=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

## GAM

Generalized additive models (GAM) allow for non-linear relationships between each feature and the response by replacing each linear component $\beta_j x_{ij}$ with a nonlinear function $f_j(x_{ij})$. The GAM model is of the form

$$y_i = \beta_0 + \sum{f_j(x_{ij})} + \epsilon_i.$$

It is called an additive model because we calculate a separate $f_j$ for each $X_j$, and then add together all of their contributions. 

The advantage of GAMs is that they automatically model non-linear relationships so you do not need to manually try out many diﬀerent transformations on each variable individually.  And because the model is additive, you can still examine the eﬀect of each $X_j$ on $Y$ individually while holding all of the other variables ﬁxed.  The main limitation of GAMs is that the model is restricted to be additive, so important interactions can be missed unless you explicitly add them.

# Support Vector Machines

These notes rely on [@James2013], [@Hastie2017], [@Kuhn2016], [PSU STAT 508](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat508/), and the [e1071 SVM vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/e1071/vignettes/svmdoc.pdf).

Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a classification model that maps observations as points in space so that the categories are divided by as wide a gap as possible. New observations can then be mapped into the space for prediction. The SVM algorithm finds the optimal separating hyperplane using a nonlinear mapping. The hyperplane is defined by the observations that lie within a margin optimized by a cost hyperparameter. These observations are called the *support vectors*.

SVM is an extension of the *support vector classifier* which in turn is a generalization of the simple and intuitive *maximal margin classifier*.  The maximal margin classifier is defined for cases where the data can be separated by a linear boundary (uncommon). The support vector classifier generalizes the maximal margin classifier by introducing a margin which permits some observations to land on wrong side of the hyperplane. The support vector machine generalizes still more by introducing non-linear hyperplanes. The best way to understand SVM is to start with the maximal margin classifier and work up.

I'll learn by example, using the `ISLR::Default` data set to predict which customers will default on their credit card debt from its 3 predictor variables. I'm using this  [Dataaspirant](https://dataaspirant.com/support-vector-machine-classifier-implementation-r-caret-package/#:~:text=For%20machine%20learning%2C%20caret%20package%20is%20a%20nice,build%20a%20hyperplane%20separating%20data%20for%20different%20classes.) tutorial for guidance. The three predictors are `student` (Yes|No), current credit card `balance`, and annual `income`.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(janitor)
library(scales)
library(patchwork)

library(caret)
library(recipes)
library(tictoc)

set.seed(123)
dat <- ISLR::Default %>% slice_sample(n = 1000)
glimpse(dat)
```

I'll build and compare models the customary way, splitting `dat` (*n* = `r comma(nrow(dat), 1)`) into `dat_train` (80%, *n* = `r nrow(dat) * .80`) to fit models, and `dat_test` (20%, *n* = `r nrow(dat) * .20`) to evaluate.

```{r}
set.seed(123)

# initial_split() partitions by `strata`, then samples `prop` percent. This 
# ensures the outcome is proportionally represented in data sets.
dat_split <- initial_split(dat, prop = .8, strata = default)
dat_train <- training(dat_split)
dat_test <- testing(dat_split)
```

Only `r percent(mean(dat$default == "Yes"), .1)` of applicants default, so this is a difficult prediction problem.

```{r}
tabyl(dat$default)
```

## Maximal Margin Classifier

The maximal margin classifier is the optimal hyperplane defined in the (rare) case where two classes are *linearly separable*. Given an $X_{n \times p}$ predictor matrix with a binary response variable $y \in \{-1, 1\}$ it *might* be possible to define a *p*-dimensional hyperplane $h(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 \dots + \beta_px_p = X_i^{'} \beta + \beta_0 = 0$ such that all of the $y_i = -1$ observations fall on the negative side of the hyperplane and the $y_i = +1$ observations fall on the positive side:

$$y_i \left(x_i^{'} \beta + \beta_0 \right) > 0$$

This *separating hyperplane* is a simple classifier, and the magnitude of $\left(x_i^{'} \beta + \beta_0 \right)$ is an indicator of confidence in the predicted classification.

If you constrain $\beta$ to be a unit vector, $||\beta|| = \sum\beta^2 = 1$, then the products of the hyperplane and response variables, $\left(x_i^{'} \beta + \beta_0 \right)$, are the positive perpendicular distances from the hyperplane. If a separating hyperplane exists, there are an infinite number of possible hyperplanes. Evaluate a hyperplane by its *margin*, $M$, the perpendicular distance to the closest observation. 

$$M = \min \left\{y_i (x_i^{'} \beta + \beta_0) \right\}.$$

The *maximal margin classifier* is the hyperplane that maximizes $M.$ The figure below (adapted from figure 9.3 from [@James2013]) shows a maximal marginal classifier. The three vectors shown in the figure anchor the hyperplane and are called the *support vectors*. Interestingly, it is only these three observations that factor into the determination of the maximal marginal classifier.

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5}
xform1 <- function(x) {2 * x + runif(1, 0.5, 2)}
xform2 <- function(x) {2 * x + runif(1, -2, -0.5)}

set.seed(1234)
x <- data.frame(x = runif(20, -1, 3), grp = c(rep("b", 10), rep("r", 10))) %>%
  mutate(
    y1 = map_dbl(x, xform1),
    y2 = map_dbl(x, xform2),
    y = if_else(grp == "b", y1, y2)
  )

x %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, color = grp)) +
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_abline(slope = 2, intercept = 0, linewidth = 1) +
  geom_abline(slope = 2, intercept = -.70, linetype = 2) +
  geom_abline(slope = 2, intercept = +.66, linetype = 2) +
  annotate("segment", x = x[10,]$x, y = x[10,]$y, xend = 1.125, yend = 2.2, 
           linetype = 3, linewidth = 1, color = "red") +
  annotate("segment", x = x[4,]$x, y = x[4,]$y, xend = 1.565, yend = 3.03, 
           linetype = 3, linewidth = 1, color = "red") +
  annotate("segment", x = x[20,]$x, y = x[20,]$y, xend = -.125, yend = -.32, 
           linetype = 3, linewidth = 1, color = "skyblue") +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, color = NULL) +
  theme_minimal()
```

So, to put it all together, if a separating hyperplane exists, one could calculate it by maximizing $M$  subject to $||\beta|| = 1$ and $y_i (x_i^{'} \beta + \beta_0) \ge M$ for all $i$. However, a separating hyperplane rarely exists. In fact, even if a separating hyperplane does exist, its maximal margin classifier is probably undesirably narrow. A maximal margin classifier is sensitive to outliers so it tends to overfit data.


## Support Vector Classifier

The maximal margin classifier can be generalized to non-separable cases using a so-called *soft margin*.  The generalization is called the *support vector classifier*.  The soft margin allows some misclassification in the interest of greater robustness to individual observations. 

The support vector classifier maximizes $M$ subject to $||\beta|| = 1$ and $y_i (x_i^{'} \beta + \beta_0) \ge M(1 - \xi_i)$ and $\sum \xi_i \le \Xi$ for all $i$. The $\xi_i$ are *slack variables* whose sum is bounded by some constant tuning parameter $\Xi$. The slack variable values indicate where the observation lies:  $\xi_i = 0$ observations lie on the correct side of the margin;  $\xi_i > 0$ observation lie on the wrong side of the margin;  $\xi_i > 1$ observations lie on the wrong side of the hyperplane.  $\Xi$ sets the tolerance for margin violation.  If $\Xi = 0$, then all observations must reside on the correct side of the margin, as in the maximal margin classifier.  $\Xi$ controls the bias-variance trade-off: as $\Xi$ increases, the margin widens and allows more violations, increasing bias and decreasing variance. Similar to the maximal margin classifier, only the observations that are on the margin or that violate the margin factor into the determination of the support vector classifier. These observations are the support vectors.

The figure below (adaptation of figure 9.7 from [@James2013]) shows two support vector classifiers. The one on the left uses a large $\Xi$ and as a result includes many support vectors. The one on the right uses a smaller $\Xi.$

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=7}
x <- data.frame(
  x = c(runif(10, -2, 1), runif(10, -1, 2)),
  y = runif(20, -3, 3),
  grp = c(rep("b", 10), rep("r", 10))
)

p <- x %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, color = grp)) +
  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_abline(slope = 2.5, intercept = 0, linewidth = 1) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, color = NULL) +
  theme_minimal()

p1 <- p +
  geom_abline(slope = 2.5, intercept = -2, linetype = 2) +
  geom_abline(slope = 2.5, intercept = +2, linetype = 2) +
  labs(title = "Large tuning paramater")

p2 <- p +
  geom_abline(slope = 2.5, intercept = -.8, linetype = 2) +
  geom_abline(slope = 2.5, intercept = +.8, linetype = 2) +
  labs(title = "Small tuning paramater")

p1 + p2
```


As $\Xi$ increases, the number of violating observations increase, and thus the number of support vectors increases. This property makes the algorithm robust to the extreme observations far away from the hyperplane. The only shortcoming with the algorithm is that it presumes a linear decision boundary.

Let's build a support vector classifier model to predict credit `default` in the `ISLM:Default` data set. I'll build the model in **caret** with the `svmLinear` method using 10-fold cross-validation (CV-10) to optimize the hyperparameters. There is only one hyperparameter for this model, the cost parameter:

```{r}
caret::modelLookup("svmLinear")
```

I'm not sure if $C = Xi$, but it seems to function the same way. The documentation notes in `e1071::svm()` say *C* is the "*cost of constraints violation (default: 1)—it is the ‘C’-constant of the regularization term in the Lagrange formulation.*" CV-10 will fit 10 models for each candidate value of *C* and keep the model with the best performance on resamples according to our evaluation metric. I can evaluate with "Accuracy", "Kappa", or "ROC". I'll use ROC, so I need to also set `summaryFunction = twoClassSummary` and `classProbs = TRUE`.

`svmLinear` expects the response variable to be a factor with labels that can double as R variable names. This data set is fine because `default` is a factor with labels "No" and "Yes". The predictor variables should be of comparable scale, but that is *not* the case here: `student` is binary, `balance` has a range of \$0 - \$2654, and `income` has a range of \$772 - \$73,554. I'll one-hot encode `student` and standardize `balance` and `income` inside a `recipe` object.

```{r svm_linear, results='hide'}
mdl_ctrl <- trainControl(
  method = "cv", number = 10,
  summaryFunction = twoClassSummary, classProbs = TRUE
)

rcpe <- recipe(default ~ ., data = dat_train) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>%
  step_center(balance, income) %>%
  step_scale(balance, income)

tic()
set.seed(1234)
capture.output(
  mdl_svm_linear <- train(
    rcpe,
    data = dat_train,
    method = "svmLinear",
    metric = "ROC",
    trControl = mdl_ctrl,
    tuneGrid = expand.grid(C = c(1e-1, 1e0, 1e1, 1e2, 1e3, 1e4))
  )
)
toc()
```

I experimented with the `tuneGrid` and found that smaller values for *C* (C <= 10) produced poorer performance on resamples and on the holdout set. Unfortunately, the time to fit the models increased with *C* so that `expand.grid(C = c(1e-1, 1e0, 1e1, 1e2, 1e3, 1e4)` ran ~6 minutes.

The cross-validation maximized ROC with *C* = 10,000. The first three values (.1, 1, and 10) resulted in models that predicted no default every time.

```{r}
mdl_svm_linear
```

As *C* increases, the model variance decreases at the expense of more bias. The plot of the optimization results makes you wonder if *C* = 100 is basically just as good as *C* = 10,000 at a fraction of the fitting time. 
```{r}
ggplot(mdl_svm_linear)
```

Predictions on the holdout set yield 96.8% accuracy. It found 15 of the 66 defaulters (sensitivity = 0.227), and misclassified 13 of the 1933 non-defaulters (specificity = 0.993). 

```{r}
preds_svm_linear <- bind_cols(
  dat_test,
  predict(mdl_svm_linear, newdata = dat_test, type = "prob"),
  Predicted = predict(mdl_svm_linear, newdata = dat_test, type = "raw")
)
confusionMatrix(preds_svm_linear$Predicted, reference = preds_svm_linear$default, positive = "Yes")
```
`Metrics::auc()` will calculate the confusion matrix values from the model using the holdout data set.  The AUC on the holdout set is 0.9541.

```{r}
mdl_svm_linear_auc <- Metrics::auc(actual = preds_svm_linear$default == "Yes", preds_svm_linear$Yes)
yardstick::roc_curve(preds_svm_linear, default, Yes) %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(
    title = "SVM Linear Model ROC Curve, Test Data",
    subtitle = paste0("AUC = ", round(mdl_svm_linear_auc, 4))
  )
```

There are just a few predictors in this model, so there is a chance I can visualize the model.

```{r}
fits_svm_linear <- bind_cols(
  dat_train,
  predict(mdl_svm_linear, newdata = dat_train, type = "prob"),
  Predicted = predict(mdl_svm_linear, newdata = dat_train, type = "raw"),
)

bind_rows(
  fits_svm_linear %>% mutate(set = "Actual", outcome = default),
  fits_svm_linear %>% mutate(set = "Fitted", outcome = Predicted)
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = balance, y = income, color = outcome)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = student), alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format()) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format()) +
  scale_color_manual(values = list(No = "#B6E2D3", Yes = "#EF7C8E")) +
  labs(title = "Training Set") +
  facet_wrap(vars(set))
```

Looks like the hyperplane slopes slightly right, so high credit card balances are a little less likely to fall into default if income is high. Distinguishing students is difficult, but they are generally at the low end of the income scale, and they seem to exert a positive association with default. Let's look at the same figure with the training set. 

```{r}
bind_rows(
  preds_svm_linear %>% mutate(set = "Actual", outcome = default),
  preds_svm_linear %>% mutate(set = "Fitted", outcome = Predicted)
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = balance, y = income, color = outcome)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = student), alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format()) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format()) +
  scale_color_manual(values = list(No = "#B6E2D3", Yes = "#EF7C8E")) +
  labs(title = "Test Set") +
  facet_wrap(vars(set))
```

Visually, the model performed consistently between the training and test sets.


## Support Vector Machines

Enlarging the feature space of the support vector classifier accommodates nonlinear relationships.  Support vector machines do this in a specific way, using *kernels*. Before diving into kernels, you need to understand (somewhat) the solution to the support vector classifier optimization problem.

The linear support vector classifier can be represented as 

$$f(x) = \beta_0 + \sum_i^n \alpha_i \langle x, x_i \rangle.$$

That is, the classification of test observation $x$ is the sum of the dot products of $x$ with all the $n$ observations in the training set, multiplied by the vector $\alpha$ (plus the constant $\beta_0$). The $\alpha$ vector is calculated from the $n \choose 2$ dot products of the training data set. Actually, the classification is simpler than that because $\alpha_i = 0$ for all observation that are not support vectors, so you can actually represent the solution as

$$f(x) = \beta_0 + \sum_{i \in S} \alpha_i \langle x, x_i \rangle$$
where $S$ is the set of support vector indices.

Now, you can generalize the inner dot product with a wrapper function, called a *kernel*, $K(x_i, x_{i^{'}})$. 

$$f(x) = \beta_0 + \sum_{i \in S} \alpha_i K(x, x_i)$$

To get the the support vector classifier, you'd defined $K$ to be a *linear* kernel: 

$$K(x_i, x_i^{'}) = \langle x, x_i \rangle$$

But you could also use other kernels, like the polynomial of degree $d$, 

$$K(x, x') = (1 + \langle x, x' \rangle)^d$$ 

or radial 

$$K(x, x') = \exp\{-\gamma ||x - x'||^2\}.$$

The figure below (figure 9.9 from [@James2013]) shows two support vector classifiers. The one on the left uses a polynomial kernel and the one on the right uses a radial kernel.

![FIGURE 9.9 from An Introduction to Statistical Learning](./images/svm_svm.png)

The SVM model can be expressed in the familiar "loss + penalty" minimization structure, $\min_{\beta} \left \{ L(X,y,\beta) + \lambda P(\beta) \right \}$ as

$$\min_\beta \left \{ \sum_{i=1}^n \max [0, 1-y_i f(x_i)] + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^p \beta_j^2 \right \}$$

Increasing $\lambda$, shrinks $\beta$ and more violations to the margin are tolerated, resulting in a lower-variance/higher-bias model. The loss function above is known as a *hinge loss*.

Let's build a support vector machine model to predict credit `default` in the `ISLM:Default` data set again. I'll try a polynomial kernel with the `svmPoly` method and a radial kernal with `svmRadial`. `svmPoly` has three hyperparameters. *What is the Scale parameter?*

```{r}
caret::modelLookup("svmPoly")
```

`svmRadial` has two hyperparameters:

```{r}
caret::modelLookup("svmRadial")
```

I'll use the same `trControl` object as with the support vector classifier, and I'll use the same one-hot encoded binaries and scaled and centered data. I fixed `scale` at its default value and tried polynomials of degree 1-3. I used the same candidate `cost` values. 

```{r svm_poly, results='hide'}
tic()
set.seed(1234)
capture.output(
  mdl_svm_poly <- train(
    rcpe,
    data = dat_train,
    method = "svmPoly",
    metric = "ROC",
    trControl = mdl_ctrl,
    tuneGrid = expand.grid(
      C = c(1e-1, 1e0, 1e1, 1e2, 1e3, 1e4),
      degree = c(1, 2, 3),
      scale = 0.001)
  )
)
toc()
```
The model ran ~3 minutes. The cross-validation maximized ROC with *degree* = 2 and *C* = 0.1.

```{r}
mdl_svm_poly
```

Here is `svmRadial`. At this point, I do not know how the sigma tuning parameter works, so I expanded around the default value used from `tuneLength = 1`.

```{r svm_radial, results='hide'}
tic()
set.seed(1234)
capture.output(
  mdl_svm_radial <- train(
    rcpe,
    data = dat_train,
    method = "svmRadial",
    metric = "ROC",
    trControl = mdl_ctrl,
    tuneGrid = expand.grid(
      C = c(1e-1, 1e0, 1e1, 1e2, 1e3),
      sigma = c(.01, .1, 1.0)
    )
  )
)
toc()
```

This model ran in ~11 minutes and optimized at *C* = 0.1 and *sigma* = 0.01.

```{r}
mdl_svm_radial
```

Here are the optimization plots I used to help tune the models. 

```{r results='hide'}
p1 <- ggplot(mdl_svm_poly) + labs(title = "SVMPoly Tuning") + 
  theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom")
p2 <- ggplot(mdl_svm_radial) + labs(title = "SVMRadial Tuning") + 
  theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom")
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
```

The polynomial model predictions on the holdout set yielded 96.85% accuracy. It found 20 of the 66 defaulters (sensitivity = 0.303), and misclassified 17 of the 1933 non-defaulters (specificity = 0.991). So the polynomial model found a few more defaulters at the expense of a few more mistakes.

The radial model predictions on the holdout set yielded 97% accuracy. It found 17 defaulters (sensitivity = 0.258), and misclassified 11 non-defaulters (specificity = 0.994). So the radial was somewhere between the linear and polynomial models.

```{r results='hide'}
preds_svm_poly <- bind_cols(
  dat_test,
  predict(mdl_svm_poly, newdata = dat_test, type = "prob"),
  Predicted = predict(mdl_svm_poly, newdata = dat_test, type = "raw")
)
confusionMatrix(preds_svm_poly$Predicted, reference = preds_svm_poly$default, positive = "Yes")

preds_svm_radial <- bind_cols(
  dat_test,
  predict(mdl_svm_radial, newdata = dat_test, type = "prob"),
  Predicted = predict(mdl_svm_radial, newdata = dat_test, type = "raw")
)
confusionMatrix(preds_svm_radial$Predicted, reference = preds_svm_radial$default, positive = "Yes")
```

The AUCs on the holdout set is where 0.9536 for the polynmomial and 0.8836 for the radial.

```{r}
Metrics::auc(actual = preds_svm_poly$default == "Yes", preds_svm_poly$Yes)
Metrics::auc(actual = preds_svm_radial$default == "Yes", preds_svm_radial$Yes)
```

Let's see what the two models look like on the training data.

```{r}
fits_svm_poly <- bind_cols(
  dat_train,
  predict(mdl_svm_poly, newdata = dat_train, type = "prob"),
  Predicted = predict(mdl_svm_poly, newdata = dat_train, type = "raw"),
)

bind_rows(
  fits_svm_poly %>% mutate(set = "Actual", outcome = default),
  fits_svm_poly %>% mutate(set = "Fitted", outcome = Predicted)
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = balance, y = income, color = outcome)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = student), alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format()) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format()) +
  scale_color_manual(values = list(No = "#B6E2D3", Yes = "#EF7C8E")) +
  labs(title = "Training Set, Polynomial Kernel") +
  facet_wrap(vars(set))
```

```{r}
fits_svm_radial <- bind_cols(
  dat_train,
  predict(mdl_svm_radial, newdata = dat_train, type = "prob"),
  Predicted = predict(mdl_svm_radial, newdata = dat_train, type = "raw"),
)

bind_rows(
  fits_svm_radial %>% mutate(set = "Actual", outcome = default),
  fits_svm_radial %>% mutate(set = "Fitted", outcome = Predicted)
) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = balance, y = income, color = outcome)) +
  geom_point(aes(shape = student), alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format()) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format()) +
  scale_color_manual(values = list(No = "#B6E2D3", Yes = "#EF7C8E")) +
  labs(title = "Training Set, Radial Kernel") +
  facet_wrap(vars(set))
```

You can see the slight curvature in the hyperplane now. The polynomial and the radial models look pretty much identical to me.

# Bayesian Regression {#BayesRegression}

## Compared to Frequentist Regression

This section is my notes from DataCamp course [Bayesian Regression Modeling with rstanarm](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/bayesian-regression-modeling-with-rstanarm/). The course refers to Andrew Gelman's book "Bayesian Data Analysis" [@Gelman2013]. It is an intuitive approach to Bayesian inference.

Frequentist regression estimates *fixed* population parameters from a *random* sample of data whose test statistics are random variables. The Bayesian approach to regression works the other direction: Bayesian regression characterizes the distribution of the *random* variable population parameters from the evidence of a *fixed* sample of data.

The frequentist p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic of equal or greater magnitude if the null hypothesis is true. The 95% confidence interval has a 95% probability of capturing the population value (repeated sampling would produce similar CIs, 95% of which would capture the population value). The 95% *credible interval* captures the confidence the value falls within the range. There is an important difference here. In the Bayesian framework, you can state the probability the parameter value falls with a specified range, but there is no equivalent in frequentist regression.

Bayesian regression uses maximum likelihood to fit the model because the integral in the denominator (the marginal distribution) cannot (or is difficult) to calculate analytically. Instead, the algorithm samples from the posterior distribution in groups (chains). Each chain begins at a random location. Each sample (iteration) moves toward the area where the combination of likelihood and prior indicates a high probability of the true parameter value residing. The more iterations per chain, the larger the total sample size, and more robust the outcome. The chains need to converge to have a stable estimate. The iterations prior to convergence are sometimes referred to as the "warm up" and are not included in the posterior distribution estimate. By default, the **rstanarm** package estimates 4 chains, each with 2,000 iterations, and the first 1,000 set aside as warm-up. The final posterior combines the chains, so is composed of 4,000 iterations.

A Bayesian model estimates each coefficient parameter and model error with a prior*likelihood/marginal dist = posterior framework. 

```{r message=FALSE}
library(rstanarm)

sink(type = "message")
stan_mdl <- stan_glm(kid_score ~ mom_iq, data = kidiq)
sink(type = "message")

summary(stan_mdl)
broom.mixed::tidy(stan_mdl)
posterior_interval(stan_mdl)

```

By default, **rstanarm** priors are normal distributions with mean 0 and variance equal to a scaler multiple of the data variance.

```{r}
prior_summary(stan_mdl)

# Calculate the adjusted scale for the intercept
2.5 * sd(kidiq$kid_score)

# Calculate the adjusted scale for `mom_iq`
(2.5 / sd(kidiq$mom_iq)) * sd(kidiq$kid_score)



```

You can override the priors to set your own:

```{r}
stan_mdl <- stan_glm(kid_score ~ mom_iq, data = kidiq,
                     prior_intercept = normal(location = 0, scale = 10, autoscale = FALSE),
                     prior = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = FALSE),
                     prior_aux = exponential(rate = 1, autoscale = FALSE))
```


Bayesian estimation samples from the posterior distribution, so there is no point estimate and test statistic.

## Model Evaluation

The R-squared statistic is not available from the summary object, but you can still calculate it manually from the model data, or use the `bayes_R2` function.

```{r}
sse <- var(stan_mdl$residuals)
ssr <- var(stan_mdl$fitted.values)
sst <- ssr + sse
r2 <- 1 - sse/sst
# bayes_R2 returns a vector of length equal to the posterior sample size.
bayes_R2(stan_mdl) %>% summary()
bayes_R2(stan_mdl) %>% quantile(c(.025, .975))
```

Bayesian regression has other model fit statistics. 

```{r}
# Calculate posterior predictive scores
predictions <- posterior_linpred(stan_mdl)
# Print a summary of the 1st replication
summary(predictions[1,])
```

Or produce a posterior predictive model check.

```{r}
# peaks of observed data and model are similar places, but there is a second 
# mode of popularity scores around 10 that is not captured by the model.
pp_check(stan_mdl, "dens_overlay")

pp_check(stan_mdl, "stat")

# mean and sd of the observed data in middle of expected distribution - these 
# two characteristics are recovered well.
pp_check(stan_mdl, "stat_2d")
```

### Model Comparison

Use the **loo** (leave on out) package to compare models. **loo** approximates cross-validation. In the initial summary, 4000 is the number of iterations in the posterior, and 434 is the number of observations in the data set.

`ekpd_loo` is the LOO estimate; `p_loo` is the effective number of parameters in the model; and `looic` is the LOO estimate converted to the deviance scale, -2 * LOO.

```{r}
stan_loo <- loo(stan_mdl)
stan_loo
```

The statistics are not useful in isolation - they should be used in comparison to competing models.

```{r results='hide'}
stan_mdl_2 <- stan_glm(kid_score ~ mom_iq * mom_hs, data = kidiq)
```

Which model has more predictive power? As a rule of thumb, if the absolute value of the difference is greater than the standard error, then the result is significant. In this case, the new model is significantly better.

```{r}
stan_loo_2 <- loo(stan_mdl_2) 

loo_compare(stan_loo, stan_loo_2)
```

### Visualization

Use `tidy()` to pull out the intercept and slope. Use the posterior distributions to create a predicted regression line from each draw in the posterior samples. These lines will show the uncertainty around the overall line.

```{r}
library(broom)

stan_tdy_2 <- tidy(stan_mdl_2)

draws <- tidybayes::spread_draws(stan_mdl_2, `(Intercept)`, mom_iq)

kidiq %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = mom_iq, y = kid_score)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(data = draws, aes(intercept = `(Intercept)`, slope = mom_iq), 
              size = 0.1, alpha = 0.2, color = "skyblue") +
  geom_abline(intercept = stan_tdy_2$estimate[1], slope = stan_tdy_2$estimate[2]) 
```

Use the model to get posterior predictions with `posterior_predict()`.

```{r}
posteriors <- posterior_predict(stan_mdl_2)

new_data <- data.frame(mom_iq = 100, mom_hs = c(0, 1))
posteriors_2 <- posterior_predict(stan_mdl_2, newdata = new_data) %>%
  as.data.frame()

colnames(posteriors_2) <- c("No HS", "Completed HS")
posteriors_2 %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "HS", values_to = "predict") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = predict)) +
  geom_density() +
  facet_wrap(~HS, ncol = 1)
```

# Mixed Effects Models

Linear mixed effects models are used for cases in which there are multiple observations from the subjects. Multiple observations violates the independence assumption of linear regression. Repeated measures ANOVA is a popular way to analyze this kind of data, but it has several shortcomings. It does not control for covariates well, does not handle missing observations within a subject, requires a continuous outcome on categorical predictors, and does not estimate the magnitude or direction of effects [@Brown2021]. 

Linear mixed effects models address all of the shortcomings of repeated measures ANOVA, and can be generalized into categorical outcomes a well.

Mixed-effects models are called “mixed” because they simultaneously model fixed and random effects. Fixed effects are population-level effects that should persist across experiments. Random effects are level effects of some grouping factor such as participants. Random effects are included in mixed-effects models to account for the fact that the behavior of particular participants or items may differ from the average trend for unspecified reasons. Including random effects resolves the non-independence problem. The fixed-intercept estimate represents the average intercept, and random intercepts allow each predictor level to deviate from this average. Mixed-effects models account for differences in variability with fixed and random slopes. These deviations are assumed to follow a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a variance that is estimated by the model.

## Linear Mixed Effects {#lme}



Logistic regression estimates the probability that a categorical dependent variable is a particular level. The dependent variable levels can be binomial, multinomial, or ordinal. The *binary* logistic regression model is

$$y_i = \mathrm{logit}(\pi_i) = \log \left( \frac{\pi_i}{1 - \pi_i} \right) = X_i \beta$$

where $\pi_i$ is the response $i$'s binary level probability. The model predicts the *log odds* of the level. Why do this? The range of outcomes need to be between 0 and 1, and a sigmoid function, $f(y) = 1 / \left(1 + e^y \right)$, does that. If the _log odds_ of the level equals $X_i\beta$, then the _odds_ of the level equals $e^{X\beta}$. You can solve for $\pi_i$ to get $\pi = \mathrm{odds} / (\mathrm{odds} + 1)$. Substituting, 

$$\pi_i = \frac{\exp(y_i)}{1 + \exp(y_i)} = \frac{e^{X_i\beta}}{1 + e^{X_i\beta}}$$

which you can simplify to $\pi_i = 1 / (1 + e^{-X_i\beta})$, a sigmoid function. The upshot is $X\beta$ is the functional relationship between the independent variables and _a function of the response_, not the response itself.

The model parameters are estimated either by _iteratively reweighted least squares optimization_ or by _maximum likelihood estimation_ (MLE). MLE maximizes the probability produced by a set of parameters $\beta$ given a data set and probability distribution.^[Notes from [Machine Learning Mastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/logistic-regression-with-maximum-likelihood-estimation/).] In logistic regression the probability distribution is the binomial and each observation is the outcome of a single Bernoulli trial. 

$$L(\beta; y, X) = \prod_{i=1}^n \pi_i^{y_i}(1 - \pi_i)^{(1-y_i)} = \prod_{i=1}^n\frac{\exp(y_i X_i \beta)}{1 + \exp(X_i \beta)}.$$

In practice, multiplying many small probabilities can be unstable, so MLE optimizes the log likelihood instead. 

$$\begin{align}
l(\beta; y, X) &= \sum_{i = 1}^n \left(y_i \log(\pi_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \pi_i) \right) \\
               &= \sum_{i = 1}^n \left(y_i X_i \beta - \log(1 + e^{X_i\beta}) \right)
\end{align}$$

Sometimes you will see the _cost function_ optimized. The cost function is the negative of of the log likelihood function.

**Assumptions**

The binomial logistic regression model requires a dichotomous dependent variable and independent observations. The sample size should be large, at least 10 observations per dependent variable level and independent variable. There are three conditions related to the data distribution: i) the logit transformation must be linearly related to any continuous independent variables, ii) there must be no multicollinearity, and iii) there must be no influential outliers.

Be aware of over-dispersion, a common issue with GLM. For a binomial logistic regression, the response variable should be distributed $y_i \sim \mathrm{Bin}(n_i, \pi_i)$ with $\mu_i = n_i \pi_i$ and $\sigma^2 = \pi (1 - \pi)$. Over-dispersion means the data shows evidence of variance greater than $\sigma^2$.

### Case Study {.unnumbered #lme1}

This case study uses data from @Brown2021's tutorial [supplemental materials](https://osf.io/v6qag/). A study presented 53 participants with 543 isolated words, some in auditory modality and some in audiovisual modality. Participants repeated the words while performing an unrelated response time task in a tactile modality. Seeing the talker helps speech recognition. Does it also improve response times in a secondary task?

```{r}
lme_cs <- list()

lme_cs$dat <- readr::read_csv("./input/mixed-effects-rt.csv", col_types = "cdcc") %>%
  mutate(modality = factor(modality, levels = c("Audio-only", "Audiovisual")))

glimpse(lme_cs$dat)

lme_cs$dat %>%
  summarize(PID = n_distinct(PID), modality = n_distinct(modality), stim = n_distinct(stim))

lme_cs$dat %>%
  gtsummary::tbl_summary(
    by = modality,
    include = -c(PID, stim),
    statistic = list(gtsummary::all_continuous() ~ "{mean}, {sd}")
  )
```

<br>

Modality will be modeled as a fixed effect because we expect an average relationship between modality and response times that will persist across different samples of participants and items. Participants and words are modeled as random effects because they are randomly sampled from their respective populations, and we want to account for variability within those populations.

```{r}
cs1$dat %>% gtsummary::tbl_cross(row = heart_disease, col = gender, percent = "col") 
```

Age, weight, and poor max aerobic capacity are positively associated with heart disease.

```{r}
cs1$dat %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(age, weight, VO2max)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = heart_disease, y = value)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(aes(color = name)) +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(name), scales = "free_y")
```

:::rmdnote
Consider centering the continuous variables around their means to facilitate model interpretation. The intercept term in the fitted model would represent a reasonable condition, not a zero-aged, zero-weighted person with no aerobic capacity. This is the way to go if you want to present your findings in the framework of a baseline probability (or odds) and the incremental effects of the independent variables. You might also standardize the continuous vars to get a more meaningful increment. On the other hand, if you want to use your model for predicting outcomes, you'll have to back out of the centering when you predict values.
:::

If your model is predictive rather than inferential, split the data into training/testing data sets.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
# For reproducibility
set.seed(123)

(x <- initial_split(cs1$dat, prop = 0.7, strata = heart_disease))

cs1$dat_training <- training(x)
dim(cs1$dat_training)

cs1$dat_testing <- testing(x)
dim(cs1$dat_testing)
```

### Fit the Model {-}

Fit the model using the tidymodels framework. If you want to continue using the classic methodology, the glm object is inside the tidymodels fit. The model fit returns a brief summary with the coefficients and model diagnostics. 

```{r}
cs1$model <- 
  logistic_reg() %>% 
  set_engine("glm") %>% 
  set_mode("classification") 

cs1$fit <-
  cs1$model %>%
  fit(heart_disease ~ age + weight + VO2max + gender, data = cs1$dat)

# The fit object returned by glm(). You'll need this for interpretation and 
# checking assumptions.
cs1$result <-
  cs1$fit %>%
  extract_fit_engine()

# If you are fitting a predictive model, use the training set.
cs1$fit_training <-
  cs1$model %>%
  fit(heart_disease ~ age + weight + VO2max + gender, data = cs1$dat_training)

cs1$result %>% summary()
```

The null deviance, G^2, is the likelihood ratio of the intercept-only model with `r nrow(cs1$dat_training)` rows - 1 parameter = `r cs1$result %>% summary() %>% .$df.null` degrees of freedom. It is the sum of the squared deviance residuals. The residual deviance is the likelihood ratio of the full model with `r nrow(cs1$dat)` - 5 parameters = `r cs1$result %>% summary() %>% .$df.residual` degrees of freedom. 

The residual deviance is distributed chi-squared and can be used to test whether the model differs from the saturated model (model with as many coefficients as observations, G^2 = 0, *df* = 0) where $H_0$ = no difference. The deviance test for lack of fit fails to reject the null hypothesis.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
# G^2 calculations
cs1$result %>% residuals(type = "deviance") %>% .^2 %>% sum()
cs1$result %>% deviance()

# df
df.residual(cs1$result)

# G^2 is distributed chi-squared with df degrees of freedom
pchisq(deviance(cs1$result), df = df.residual(cs1$result), lower.tail = FALSE)
vcdExtra::LRstats(cs1$result)
```

These two deviances, the null and residual, are shown in the ANOVA summary. An ANOVA table shows the change in deviance from successively adding each variable to the model.

```{r}
anova(cs1$result)
```

Deviance residuals are one of four residuals you can calculate from a binary logistic regression.^[[UVA](https://data.library.virginia.edu/understanding-deviance-residuals/) discusses the four types of residuals you can calculate from a binary logistic regression.] One is the *raw residual*, $\epsilon_i = y_i - \hat{p}_i$, where $\hat{p}_i$ is the predicted probability. Another is the *Pearson residual*, $r_i = \frac{\epsilon_i}{\sqrt{\hat{p}_i(1 - \hat{p}_i)}}$, the raw residual rescaled by dividing by the estimated standard deviation of a binomial distribution with 1 trial^[See probability notes on the binomial distribution [here](https://bookdown.org/mpfoley1973/probability/binomial.html)]. A third is the *standardized Pearson residual*, $rs_i = r_i / \sqrt{1 - \hat{h}_i}$, the Pearson residual adjusted for the leverage of the predictors using the hat-values. Hat-values measure the predictor distances from the mean. This residual is especially useful to evaluate model fit because if the model fits well, these residuals have a standard normal distribution. Finally, there are the *deviance residuals*, $d_i = \mathrm{sign}(\epsilon_i) \left[ -2(y_i \log \hat{p}_i + (1 - y_i) \log (1 - \hat{p}_i)) \right]^{.5}$. Deviance Residuals measure how much the estimated probabilities differ from the observed proportions of success. You want deviance residuals to be evenly distributed (in absolute values, 1Q $\approx$ 3Q, min $\approx$ max). You also want the min and max to be <3 because deviance residuals are roughly approximated by a standard normal distribution.

```{r}
bind_rows(
  Raw = cs1$result %>% residuals(type = "response") %>% summary(),
  Pearson = cs1$result %>% residuals(type = "pearson") %>% summary(),
  `Standardized Pearson` = cs1$result %>% rstandard(type = "pearson") %>% summary(),
  Deviance = cs1$result %>% residuals(type = "deviance") %>% summary(),
  .id = "Residual"
)
```

### Interpretation {-}

Before we look at the coefficient estimations, consider what it is they are predicting: the log odds of the binary response. To see what that means, plug in values for the explanatory variables to get predictions. $\hat{y}$ is the log odds of having heart disease. 

```{r collapse=TRUE}
(mean_person <- 
  cs1$dat %>%
  select(-caseno) %>%
  summarize(.by = gender, across(where(is.numeric), mean)))

pred_log_odds <- cs1$fit %>% predict(new_data = mean_person, type = "raw")
names(pred_log_odds) <- mean_person$gender
pred_log_odds
```

Exponentiate to get the **odds**, $\exp (\hat{y}) = \frac{\pi}{1 - \pi}$.

```{r}
(pred_odds <- exp(pred_log_odds))
```

Solve for $\pi = \frac{\exp (\hat{y})}{1 + \exp (\hat{y})}$ to get the **probability**. Do the math, or use `predict(type = "prob")`.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
(pred_prob <- pred_odds / (1 + pred_odds))
cs1$fit %>% predict(new_data = mean_person, type = "prob")
```

Now let's interpret the coefficients.

```{r}
cs1$fit %>% tidy()
```

The intercept term is the log-odds of heart disease for the reference case. The reference case in the model is `gender` = "Female", `age` = 0, `weight` = 0, and `VO2max` = 0. If the data was centered, the reference case would actually meaningful.

```{r}
cs1$fit %>%
  predict(new_data = list(age = 0, weight = 0, VO2max = 0, gender = "Female"), 
          type = "raw")
```

Column "statistic" is the Wald $z$ statistic, $z = \hat{\beta} / SE(\hat{\beta})$. Its square is the Wald chi-squared statistic. The _p_-value is the area to the right of $z^2$ in the $\chi_1^2$ density curve:

```{r}
cs1$fit %>% 
  tidy() %>%
  mutate(p.chisq = map_dbl(statistic, ~pchisq(.^2, df = 1, lower.tail = FALSE))) %>%
  pull(p.chisq)
```

Interpret the coefficient estimates as the change in the log odds of $y$ due to a one unit change in $x$. If $\delta = x_a - x_b$, then a $\delta$ change in $x$ is associated with a $\delta \hat{\beta}$ change in the log odds of $y$. $\beta$ is the log odds ratio of $x_a$ vs $x_b$.

$$\log \left(\pi / (1 - \pi) |_{x = x_a} \right) - \log \left(\pi / (1 - \pi) |_{x = x_b} \right) = \log \left( \frac{\pi / (1 - \pi) |_{x = x_a}}{\pi / (1 - \pi) |_{x = x_b}} \right) = \delta \hat{\beta}$$

The *exponential* of the coefficient estimates is the change in the _odds_ of $y$ due to a $\delta$ change in $x$. $\exp \beta$ is the odds ratio of $x_a$ vs $x_b$.

$$\mathrm{odds}(y) = e^{\delta \hat{\beta}}$$

```{r}
cs1$fit %>% tidy(exponentiate = TRUE)
```

All covariates held equal, a male's log odds of heart disease are `r comma(coefficients(cs1$result)["genderMale"], .01)` times that of a female's (log(OR)). A male's odds are `r comma(exp(coefficients(cs1$result)["genderMale"]), .01)` times that of a female's (OR). Of course, all covariate's are _not_ equal - males are heavier and have higher VO2max. Let's run the calculations with the mean predictor values for male and female.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
# Log OR
pred_log_odds["Male"] / pred_log_odds["Female"]

# OR
pred_odds["Male"] / pred_odds["Female"]
```

A one-unit increase in any of the continuous independent variables is interpreted similarly. The reference level is unimportant since the change is constant across the range of values. A one year increase in age increases the log-odds of heart disease by a factor of `r comma(coefficients(cs1$result)["age"], .01)`, and the odds by a factor of `r comma(exp(coefficients(cs1$result)["age"]), .01)`. To calculate the effect of a *decade* increase in age, multiply $\beta$ by 10 before exponentiating, or raise the exponentiated coeficient by 10. The effect of a 10-year increase in age is to increase the odds of heart disease by `r comma(exp(coefficients(cs1$result)["age"] * 10), .01)`. The odds double every ten years.

`oddsratio::or_glm()` is a handy way to calculate odds ratios from arbitrary increments to the predictors. Here are the ORs of a 10-year age change, 10 kg weight change, and VO2max change of 5.

```{r}
oddsratio::or_glm(
  cs1$dat, 
  cs1$result, 
  incr = list(age = 10, weight = 25, VO2max = -12)
)
```

Notice that the predicted probabilities have the sigmoidal shape of the binary relationship.

```{r message=FALSE}
augment(cs1$fit, new_data = cs1$dat, type = "raw") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age, color = gender)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = as.numeric(heart_disease == "Yes"))) +
  geom_point(aes(y = .pred_Yes), shape = 4) +
  geom_smooth(aes(y = .pred_Yes), se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Age",
       y = NULL,
       title = "Binary Fitted Line Plot") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0,1), labels = c("Healthy", "Heart Disease")) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(legend.position = "right")
```

### Assumptions {-}

Four assumptions relate to the study design: (1) the dependent variable is dichotomous; (2) the observations are independent; (3) the categories of all nominal variables are mutually exclusive and exhaustive; and (4) there are at least 10 observations per dependent variable level and independent variable. These assumptions are all valid here. Three more assumptions related to the data distribution: 

- There is a linear relationship between the logit transformation and the continuous independent variables. Test with a plot and with Box-Tidwell.

- There is no independent variable multicollinearity. Test with correlation coefficients and variance inflation factors (VIF).

- There are no influential outliers. Test with Cook's distance. 

Test the linearity assumption first. There are two ways to do this (do both). First, fit your model, then plot the _fitted values_ against the continuous predictors. This is the GLM analog to OLS bivariate analysis, except now the dependent variable is the _logit_ transformation. These plotted relationships look pretty linear.

```{r}
cs1$fit %>%
  augment(new_data = cs1$dat) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(age, weight, VO2max)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = .pred_Yes)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(name), scales = "free_x") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = "y~x") +
  labs(title = "Linearity Test: predicted vs continuous predictors", x = NULL)
```

The second test for linearity is the Box-Tidwell approach. Add transformations of the continuous independent variables to the model, $x_{Tx} = x \log x$, then test their significance level in the fit.

```{r}
# Using non-centered vars to avoid log(0) errors.
x <- 
  cs1$dat %>%
  mutate(
    age_tx = log(age) * age,
    weight_tx = log(weight) * weight,
    VO2max_tx = log(VO2max) * VO2max
  )

cs1$boxtidwell_fit <- 
  logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  fit(heart_disease ~ age + weight + VO2max + gender + 
        age_tx + weight_tx + VO2max_tx, 
      data = x)

cs1$boxtidwell_fit %>% tidy()
```

Focus on the three transformed variables. `age_tx` is the only one with a *p*-value nearly <.05, but it is customary to apply a Bonferroni adjustment when testing for linearity. There are eight predictors in the model (including the intercept term), so the Bonferroni adjusted *p*-value for `age_tx` is multiplied by 8. Do not reject the null hypothesis of linearity.

If the relationship _was_ nonlinear, you could try transforming the variable by raising it to $\lambda = 1 + b / \gamma$ where $b$ is the estimated coefficient of the model without the interaction terms, and $\gamma$ is the estimated coefficient of the interaction term of the model with interactions. For `age`, $b$ is `r comma(coefficients(cs1$result)["age"], .001)` and $\gamma$ is `r comma(coefficients(cs1$boxtidwell_fit$fit)["age_tx"], .001)`, so $\lambda$ = `r comma(1 + coefficients(cs1$fit$fit)["age"] / coefficients(cs1$boxtidwell_fit$fit)["age_tx"], .001)`. This is approximately 1 (no transformation). It appears to be customary to apply general transformations like .5 (square root), 1/3 (cube root), ln, and the reciprocal.

Now check for multicollinearity. Variance inflation factors (VIF) estimate how much the variance of a regression coefficient is inflated due to multicollinearity. When independent variables are correlated, it is difficult to say which variable really influences the dependent variable. The VIF for variable $i$ is

$$
\mathrm{VIF}_i = \frac{1}{1 - R_i^2}
$$

where $R_i^2$ is the coefficient of determination (i.e., the proportion of dependent variance explained by the model) of a regression of $X_i$ against all of the other predictors, $X_i = X_{j \ne i} \beta + \epsilon$. If $X_i$ is totally unrelated to its covariates, then $R_i^2$ will be zero and $\mathrm{VIF}_i$ will be 1. If $R_i^2$ is .8, $\mathrm{VIF}_i$ will be 5. The rule of thumb is that $R_i^2 \le 5$ is tolerable, and $R_i^2 > 5$ is "highly correlated" and you have to do something about it. These are excellent.

```{r}
car::vif(cs1$result)
```

Try calculating the $\mathrm{VIF}$ for `age`.

:::rmdnote
I don't know why this doesn't work. It _would_ work if the underlying model was OLS instead of GLM. The answer seems to be related to GVIF vs VIF, but I didn't figure it out.)

  filter(abs(.std.resid) >= 2) %>% 
  pull(.std.resid)
```

Now check for influential outliers. Predict the response probabilities and filter for the predictions more than two standard deviations from the actual value and a Cook's Distance greater than 4/N = `r 4 / nrow(cs1$dat)`.^[[This article](https://towardsdatascience.com/assumptions-of-logistic-regression-clearly-explained-44d85a22b290) suggests using three standard deviations for an outliers threshold.] Cook's distance measures how much predicted values change when observation *i* is removed from the data. Only two fitted values were both an outlier and influential, row ids 59 and 70. An index plot of Cook's Distance shows the two points at the far left. You might examine the observations for validity. Otherwise, proceed and explain that there were two standardized residuals with value of `r comma(cs1$outliers[1], .01)` and `r comma(cs1$outliers[2], .01)` standard deviations which were kept in the analysis. 

```{r warning=FALSE}
augment(cs1$result) %>%
  mutate(
    id = row_number(),
    outlier = if_else(abs(.std.resid) >= 2, "Outlier", "Other"),
    influential = if_else(.cooksd > 4 / nrow(cs1$dat), "Influential", "Other"),
    status = case_when(
      outlier == "Outlier" & influential == "Influential" ~ "Influential Outlier",
      outlier == "Outlier" ~ "Outlier",
      influential == "Influential" ~ "Influential",
      TRUE ~ "Other"
    )
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = .fitted, y = .cooksd)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = status)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = if_else(influential == "Influential", id, NA_integer_)), 
            check_overlap = TRUE, size = 3, nudge_x = .025) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 4 / nrow(cs1$dat), linetype = 2, color = "goldenrod") + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Influential Outlier" = "firebrick", 
                                "Influential" = "goldenrod",
                                "Outlier" = "slategray",
                                "Other" = "black")) +
  theme(legend.position = "right") +

### Evaluate the Fit {-}

There are several ways to evaluate the model fit. 

- The likelihood ratio test
- Pseudo R-squared^[Nice explanation [here](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/faq/general/faq-what-are-pseudo-r-squareds/). Sounds like you should use pseudo R2 for model comparison, not for reporting goodness of fit].
- Accuracy measures
- Gain and ROC curves

The **likelihood ratio test** compares the log likelihood of the fitted model to an intercept-only model.

```{r}
intercept_only <-
  logistic_reg() %>%
  set_engine("glm") %>%
  set_mode("classification") %>%
  fit(heart_disease ~ 1, data = cs1$dat)

(cs1$lrtest <- lmtest::lrtest(cs1$result, intercept_only$fit))
```

The fitted model is significant, $\chi^2$(`r abs(cs1$lrtest$Df[2])`) = `r comma(cs1$lrtest$Chisq[2], .1)`, *p* < .001. Calculate the pseuedo-R2 with `DescTools::PseudoR2()`.

:::rmdnote
I Can't get this to work in the tidymodels framework. Using `glm()` for now.
:::

```{r}
x <- glm(heart_disease ~ age + weight + VO2max + gender, 
         data = cs1$dat,
         family = "binomial")
cs1$pseudo_r2 <- DescTools::PseudoR2(x, which = c("CoxSnell", "Nagelkerke", "McFadden"))

cs1$pseudo_r2
```

Laerd interprets this as the model explained `r percent(cs1$pseudo_r2["Nagelkerke"], .1)` (Nagelkerke R2) of the variance in heart disease. This is how your would interpret R2 in an OLS model. [UCLA](https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/faq/general/faq-what-are-pseudo-r-squareds/) points out that the various pseudo R-squareds measure other aspects of the model and are unique to the measured quantity. A pseudo R-squared is not very informative on its own; it is useful for comparing models. Accuracy measures formed by the cross-tabulation of observed and predicted classes is the better way to go.

```{r collapse=TRUE}
cs1$conf_mat <-
  cs1$fit %>% 
  augment(new_data = cs1$dat) %>%
  # conf_mat requires truth to be first level of the factor variable.
  mutate(across(c(heart_disease, .pred_class), ~fct_relevel(., "Yes"))) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = heart_disease, estimate = .pred_class)

cs1$conf_mat

cs1$conf_mat %>% summary()

cs1$conf_mat %>% autoplot()
```

The model accuracy, `r cs1$conf_mat %>% summary() %>% filter(.metric == "accuracy") %>% pull(.estimate) %>% percent(.1)`, is the percent of observations correctly classified. The sensitivity, `r cs1$conf_mat %>% summary() %>% filter(.metric == "sens") %>% pull(.estimate) %>% percent(.1)`, is the accuracy with regard to predicting positive cases. The specificity, `r cs1$conf_mat %>% summary() %>% filter(.metric == "spec") %>% pull(.estimate) %>% percent(.1)`, is the accuracy with regard to predicting negative cases. If you are fitting a predictive model, use the testing data set for this.

```{r}
cs1$fit_training %>% 
  augment(new_data = cs1$dat_testing) %>%
  conf_mat(truth = heart_disease, estimate = .pred_class)
```

Finally, plot the [gain curve or ROC curve](https://community.tibco.com/wiki/gains-vs-roc-curves-do-you-understand-difference). In the **gain curve**, the x-axis is the fraction of items seen when sorted by the predicted value, and the y-axis is the cumulatively summed true outcome. The "wizard" curve is the gain curve when the data is sorted by the true outcome.  If the model's gain curve is close to the wizard curve, then the model predicts the response well. The gray area is the "gain" over a random prediction.

```{r}
cs1$dat_testing %>%
  bind_cols(predict(cs1$fit, new_data = cs1$dat_testing, type = "prob")) %>%
  # event_level = "second" sets the second level as success
  yardstick::gain_curve(.pred_Yes, truth = heart_disease, event_level = "second") %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(title = "Gain Curve")
```

`r sum(cs1$dat_testing$heart_disease == "Yes")` of the `r nrow(cs1$dat_testing)` participants had heart disease in the test data set. 

- The gain curve encountered 6 heart disease cases (50%) within the first 8 observations (55%). It encountered all 11 heart disease cases on the 18th observation.
- The bottom of the grey area is the outcome of a random model. Only half the heart disease cases would be observed within 50% of the observations.  
- The top of the grey area is the outcome of the perfect model, the "wizard curve". Half the heart disease cases would be observed in 6/30=20% of the observations.

The **ROC** (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curve plots sensitivity vs specificity at varying cut-off values for the probability ranging from 0 to 1. Ideally, you want very little trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, with a curve hugging the left and top axes.

```{r}
cs1$dat_testing %>%
  bind_cols(predict(cs1$fit, new_data = cs1$dat_testing, type = "prob")) %>%
  # event_level = "second" sets the second level as success
  yardstick::roc_curve(.pred_Yes, truth = heart_disease, event_level = "second") %>%
  autoplot() +
  labs(title = "ROC Curve")
```

### Reporting {-}

> A binomial logistic regression was performed to ascertain the effects of age, weight, gender and VO2max on the likelihood that participants have heart disease. Linearity of the continuous variables with respect to the logit of the dependent variable was assessed via the Box-Tidwell (1962) procedure. A Bonferroni correction was applied using all eight terms in the model resulting in statistical significance being accepted when *p* < `r comma(.05/8, .00001)` (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2014). Based on this assessment, all continuous independent variables were found to be linearly related to the logit of the dependent variable. There were two standardized residuals with value of `r comma(cs1$outliers[1], .01)` and `r comma(cs1$outliers[2], .01)` standard deviations, which were kept in the analysis. The logistic regression model was statistically significant, χ2(4) = 27.40, p < .001. The model explained `r percent(cs1$pseudo_r2["Nagelkerke"], .1)` (Nagelkerke R2) of the variance in heart disease and correctly classified `r cs1$conf_mat %>% summary() %>% filter(.metric == "accuracy") %>% pull(.estimate) %>% percent(.1)` of cases. Sensitivity was `r cs1$conf_mat %>% summary() %>% filter(.metric == "sens") %>% pull(.estimate) %>% percent(.1)`, specificity was `r cs1$conf_mat %>% summary() %>% filter(.metric == "spec") %>% pull(.estimate) %>% percent(.1)`, positive predictive value was `r percent(cs1$confusion_matrix$byClass["Pos Pred Value"], .1)` and negative predictive value was `r percent(cs1$confusion_matrix$byClass["Neg Pred Value"], .1)`. Of the five predictor variables only three were statistically significant: age, gender and VO2max (as shown in Table 1). Females had `r exp(-coef(cs1$result)["genderMale"]) %>% comma(.01)` times lower odds to exhibit heart disease than males. Increasing age was associated with an increased likelihood of exhibiting heart disease, but increasing VO2max was associated with a reduction in the likelihood of exhibiting heart disease.
